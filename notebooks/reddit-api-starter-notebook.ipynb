You will do this by making a copy of [.env_template](../.env_template) and renaming it to `.env` and making sure it is in the root directory of the project. You will need to reach out to a team organizer that can provide help with getting the `reddit_client_id`, `reddit_client_secret`, and `reddit_user_agent` set up based on the [https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/quick_start.html](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/quick_start) documentation.\n",
