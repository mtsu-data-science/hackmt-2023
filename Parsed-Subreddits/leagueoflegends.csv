"Its time to release the nuke, Riot is clearly out of money they need to drop Pool Party Ahri as soon as possible","Im sure I dont need to explain for anyone that has seen the 2023 cinematic. They really showed off like a 2 minute unreal engine tech demo of summoners rift with a lady talking over an old song they made (the climb) years ago. The batch of videos they just released beforehand was them reiterating old information we already know pretty much 95% of the time. They have spent a year working on Skarner rework and the only thing they showed us were concept images we saw a year ago

Clearly Riot is out of money. My condolences to all the employees on the league team (all 10 of them) working on such a meager budget. I wouldnt be surprised if they werent even being paid anymore as Valorant and other projects suck up all their funds. I think the league team needs to bite the bullet and finally release their skin they've been holding back for years: Pool Party Ahri. Honestly they seem to be in such dire straits we might need Pool Party Kaisa, Lux, and Irelia to truly recover some semblance of a budget. Do what you guys have to do to make league great again

Edit: Sorry didnt mean to neglect also all the LCS and LEC changes that will probably hit them all huge as well. Having long time talent just be phased out without even consulting them and changing the schedule to be objectively worse and what not. Please someone help these guys",13284.0,0.0,0.16874505579471588,0.0037010181695222855,0.827553927898407,0.7593030333518982,0.23066596686840057,0.010030974633991718
The best way to play League as a boomer is to pick Malzahar use point-and-click CC on the zoomer champions and watch them RAGE in All Chat. It's almost therapeutic.,"I love it. It's almost every game.

Nothing better than watching some edgelord try go crazy on Irelia with mechanics only for him to be totally shut down by the click of a button.

Rage ensues.

Best part is they have too much ego to buy QSS. Doesn't hit that dopamine spike I guess compared to buying another busted bruiser item.

[Bonus points when they add you after game.](

I chose a tame one for that picture. I've had plenty of people wish me and my family all sorts of illnesses.",11624.0,0.0,0.7775559425354004,0.013775050640106201,0.2086690366268158,0.019590571522712708,0.9786862730979919,0.00172315479721874
