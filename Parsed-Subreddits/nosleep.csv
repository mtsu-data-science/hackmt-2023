My wife received an invitation to a store opening. I don't think I'll ever see her again.,"“Darren, did you know they opened a Target in Owingsville?” my wife Deborah asked me excitedly. “Grab the car keys and let's go check it out!”

I rolled my eyes. It was almost six in the evening and I had a long day at work. The prospect of an hour's drive there, two hours of shopping, and an hour's drive home wasn’t appealing.

“They didn’t open a damn Target in Owingsville,” I replied curtly. “Only about two thousand people live there. Why in the hell would a multibillion-dollar corporation open a store in the middle of the sticks in a town that isn’t big enough to support a McDonald’s?”

Squealing wood on tile penetrated my ears as she pushed the barstool away from the kitchen counter. Her footfalls approaching my chair were heavy like a pouting child’s. I should have known better than to start an argument with her about Target.

She dropped something from above me. A glossy red mailer advertisement sailed through the air over the top of my head. I looked down at my lap to see the familiar red and white logo. The cluster of red vested employees smiled up at me from the shiny cardstock.

*Target would like to welcome you to our newest location in Owingsville, KY. Bring this ad to the registered for an additional 10% off of your first purchase!*

She worshiped the damn place. We lived in Lexington, Kentucky and she made the rounds between all three. *The Clearance Queen*, she called herself. Deb would buy clearance items by the carload from any Target within a reasonable drive and resell them on Amazon.

Retail arbitrage, I think she called it.

Don’t get me wrong. She made some decent money with it. We were middle-aged and empty nesters when she started. Her entire life had been devoted to raising the kids. When Dustin and Jessica left for college she struggled a bit. Stirred around the house like a caged animal.

I pushed her to find a hobby. It was a few years until I would retire. Most of her friends worked.

That’s when the Target clearance sprees started.

“Owingsville is almost an hour away and there are three damn Targets here in town,” I said, irritation building. “Why do we need to drive out to the middle of nowhere to get what we could find in town?”

My wife went back to the kitchen and started washing the dishes. Every movement she made was exaggerated to show her displeasure. Cabinets closed so hard they were just shy of a slam. Glasses hammered on the counter so hard I expected to hear them shatter. She signed at least three times a minute.

I wish I hadn’t given in. If I would have just stood my ground, maybe everything would have been alright. Our family would still be whole. Police detectives wouldn’t stop by the house every week “just for a chat.”

But I did give in.

I agreed to go.

“Grab your purse and put on your shoes,” I huffed, pushing myself out of the recliner. “We can go, but no more than an hour of shopping. I’ve got to work in the morning so we can’t fool around all night.”

She squealed with excitement and ran off to the bedroom.

Why the hell did I agree to go?

\*\*\*\*\*

The drive to Owingsville was uneventful. NPR news stories played on the radio as my wife fidgeted with her cell phone. While I had been mildly irritated before we left the house, I was almost to a raging boil by the time we got to Owingsville.

An hour's drive to the middle of the country and my wife looked at Amazon listings the entire drive.

We had already reached the center of Owingsville and the GPS said there were still two and a half miles to go. From the overhead view on the map, the address was a good distance outside of town headed toward Morehead. The location of the store was making less sense at the moment.

“Are you sure you put the right address in the GPS?” I asked Deborah.

She didn’t answer, still scrolling through her phone.

“Deborah,” I said a bit louder. She looked up at me and smiled. The sweetness of it cooled my anger down to a dull simmer. I even felt bad for being angry. Her life had changed so much in the last year and this was something she did to pass some lonely times. “Sweety, are you sure you put in the right address? I really don’t think this can be right.”

Deb leaned over and pulled out the cardstock advertisement from her purse and looked at the address. Reaching over, she pulled the GPS from the dashboard and punched a few buttons. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see a confused expression consume her face.

“Yeah,” she said. “It’s the right address. The weird thing is the GPS just corrected itself. It was down to two miles and jumped back up to two and a half miles. Still says it’s straight ahead on the right though.”

I wasn’t concerned yet, but I was confused. The GPS clearly said two and a half miles when we pulled out of Owingsville onto the dark country lane. We had been on the road for nearly a minute. It could have been a glitch in the software, but it still left me with an uneasy feeling.

My eyes darted back and forth from the GPS screen and the darting yellow lines in the center of the road. The mileage was decreasing as it should have and I felt relieved. Only a mile ahead, we would be there soon. I looked back at the road and looked for parking lot lights in the distance.

“*You missed your destination. Please make a u-turn when able and head back two and a half miles. Your destination will be on the right side of the road.”*

“What the hell?” I said in a panic. The GPS had just said one mile only moments before. There was no way I had driven a mile and a half past a huge department store on the side of a dark country highway and missed it. “You’ve got to be kidding me!”

I pulled the car onto the shoulder and made a U-turn. As we drove back in the direction that we came, my fluttered with nervous energy. Something was wrong, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.

Was I zoning out while we drove?

Was the GPS malfunctioning?

Did the damn store even exist?

Just a moment before I was going to tell my wife we were heading home, I could see an unnaturally bright light ahead in the woodline. The tops of parking lot lights peaked over the top of the forest. I turned to Deborah to voice my concern, but her face was painted with a satisfied grin.

“I told you we’d find it,” she exclaimed with excitement. We pulled around the treeline to see an immense parking lot in front of the brightly lit store. There were maybe three cars parked at the far side of the lot. The car returns were empty. It looked like no one had been there other than a few employees. “You were all worked up over nothing.”

I pulled the car into a parking space closest to the door. We got out and started walking toward the entrance. There was emotionless elevator music playing in the parking lot. I looked up toward the tops of the light poles but didn’t see any speakers. None of the Targets in Lexington played the canned music, and it filled me with a strange sense of dread. It was as though it came from nowhere.

Even the entrance to the building was strange. While most stores have an entrance directly in the center of the building or two mirrored entrances on each end of the building, there was only one here. It was almost directly at the far right corner of the building.

I looked to my left and saw the three other cars in the lot were parked all the way to the right. Maybe there was an employee door on the side of the building, but I couldn’t see a walkway. There were four or five feet of grass between the parking lot and the edge of the building.

Something about the exterior was offputting as well.

Every other store I had seen was a cream or beige color with a few red awnings and a red Target logo next to the store name. Not this one. The entire building was fire engine red. It reminded me of the unrealistically bright blood from the old eighties slasher films.

Where there would usually be only one Target logo, the building was covered in them. Hundreds maybe. All different sizes. Some of the larger logos had smaller ones between the red and white circles. A few overlapped.

Strangest of all, there was no sign that just said *Target*.

“Deb, something about this is weirding me out,” I said hesitantly. “Let’s come back tomorrow during the day. Looks like they could be closed anyhow. Not many cars in the lot.”

She stopped and turned toward me. The exuberant grin had vanished from her face and was replaced by a set of furrowed brows. Her body was slightly rigid and her head turned slowly from side to side.

“We drove an hour to get her and you nearly got us lost twice,” she said angrily. “Don’t you think for a second we’re going home. If you’re going to act like an ass the whole time, go wait in the car.”

I was a bit dumbstruck. Deb was usually soft-spoken and sweet. Only a hand full of times had I ever heard her curse. Never at me.

She turned and went through the sliding doors at the front of the store.

Hurt and angry, I went back to the car.

\*\*\*\*\*

For the first thirty minutes Deb was inside, I scanned the parking lot like a prey animal searching for a hunter. No cars passed on the main road and no one pulled into the parking lot. There was no motion that I could detect through the glass doors into the building. Occasionally a light would flicker in the parking lot. Otherwise, things seemed relatively normal.

I tried to call Deborah once or twice but didn’t get an answer. Halfway through a lengthy, apologetic text message, I decided to leave her alone. She probably needed time to cool off and Target bargain shopping was probably the best medicine for that.

At some point, I fell asleep. It wasn’t intentional, but there is only so much aimless scrolling on a smartphone I can do before I start to nod in and out. Once I start to drift, an involuntary nap is always in my future.

I had been asleep for around forty-five minutes when my cell phone began to buzz in my hand. Startled by the sudden motion, I looked down at my phone. There was a text message from Deb. I thought it was just Deb telling me she was running behind but checking out.

***Help me.***

The messaging was confusing. Did she want help carrying something to the car? Was there something she wanted my opinion on? I sent a reply.

***What do you need help with, sweety?***

No response. Three minutes passed. I tried again.

***You okay?***

Another few minutes and still no reply.

***I’m getting worried. Do I need to come in?***

I waited for another minute but she never texted me back. Unsnapping my seatbelt, I pushed the door of the car open and felt resistance and a loud *smack*. Looking to my left, there was a yellow car next to me. It hadn’t been there when I went to sleep and I had just slammed my door into the side of it.

There was just enough room for me to slide out, so I wedged myself sideways and closed my door. Bending over, I looked at the side of the yellow car where my door had made contact. There was no dent or mark. With relief, I stood and turned to head toward the door.

I was started by an ocean of yellow cars. There were dozens of makes and models, but each vehicle in the lot was yellow. Almost every single parking space was filled.

But there was no one in the parking lot.

When I turned to head toward the door, there was no one moving around inside that I could see from there.

My stomach dropped.

Something was wrong.

\*\*\*\*\*

When I passed through the entryway doors, the store looked like it should with a few exceptions. All of the registers were self-checkout with no place for an attendant. Where you would expect to find a customer service department, there was an empty red wall. There was a cart corral but it stood empty. All of the products I could see on the shelf had no writing. Just the Target logo and a picture of what was inside.

Strangest of all was the lack of people.

The only noise in the building was a keyboard version of *The Girl from Ipanema*. It had a tinny quality to it, as though it were playing from a World War 2 era radio. Crackles of static pierced through occasionally causing me to wince.

“Hello?” I said loudly. It wasn’t quite a shout, but there was more volume to it than my normal speaking voice. It took most of my willpower not to scream at the top of my lungs, but I didn’t want to make myself seem unstable if it turned out there were other people in the store.

*There has to be someone else here,* I thought to myself. *Why the hell would the parking lot be full if no one was inside?*

No one answered my call.

“Excuse me!” I said a bit louder. My footfalls almost seemed to echo as I walked into the store. “Deborah? Can you hear me?”

Silence.

“Is anyone in this damn building?” I screamed. My temples were throbbing and it felt like the canned music pouring from the speakers grew louder to drown out my calls. I was running down the aisles, looking side to side frantically. Passing row after row of generic shelves filled with red packaging, I screamed my wife’s name over and over.

My phone vibrated in my pocket and I pulled it out. Another text from Deborah.

***Please get me out of here.***

A chill ran up my spine.

***Can you hear me screaming for you?***

The ellipsis bubble popped up showing she was typing a response.

***No. I can only hear the red men. I’m hiding from them in the bathroom. Please come help me.***

I didn’t have time to register what she meant by “the red men”. Breaking into a run, I headed toward the back of the store. As I passed by the clothing section I panicked and jumped back, slamming into a rack filled with clothing.

A red faceless man was standing on a platform behind the rows of clothing.

Terrified, I pushed myself backward and hid behind a shelf. There was no sound of movement. Only the tinny music playing from overhead. I couldn’t decide if the red man hadn’t seen me. After a few moments, I slowly peeked my head around the shelf toward the clothing section.

The man stood stoically behind the rows of clothing. Bright lines of light reflected off of his smooth body. He didn’t move at all.

*It’s a mannequin*, I thought. *Move your ass and find Deborah.*

I stood and walked back around the shelf. Without the lens of fear, I could see that the shiny red man was only a mannequin. There were no clothes on it yet. Maybe the store opened before they were able to finish setting up the store.

As I walked past it, my pulse slowed. I could see the bathroom sign hanging from the ceiling overhead and moved in that direction. As soon as I got Deborah out of the bathroom, we were going to get out of there and blow every stop light between Owingsville and Lexington.

Then I heard footsteps.

When I turned to face the clothing section, I could see the bright red mannequin was off of the pedestal. It stood on the bright white tiles of the walkway. In only a moment, the thing had moved at least fifteen feet in my direction.

There was no one around.

“What the hell?” I said aloud.

Slowly, I began to walk backward toward the bathroom, keeping my eyes locked on the mannequin. It didn’t move, but I had the uncomfortable feeling that it was watching me with its featureless face. Sweat began to pour from my forehead.

Suddenly there were steps behind me.

I spun around to see another red mannequin standing about one hundred feet on the other side of me. As I looked in its direction, I could hear more footsteps behind my back. When I turned, the mannequin from the clothing department was a few feet closer to me.

Before I could collect my thoughts, both of the shining red mannequins burst into a spring toward me. I panicked and ran into the aisle behind me. Their hard feet clacked on the floor, easily making gains on me. Twenty years past my prime, I wasn’t used to much physical exertion anymore. I hadn’t run more than two aisles and I had already lost my breath.

Entering a box of shelves, I turned to face the oncoming red mannequins. Desperate, I searched the shelves near me for a weapon. It was a home goods section and I began to scan the shelves. At the end of the shelf to my right was a cheap-looking red-handled chef’s knife. I lunged for it just in time.

As I pulled off the plastic cover, the two red men came around the corner.

I extend the knife toward both of them and they stopped. Both of them tilted their head side to side like confused dogs. They turned toward each other as one of them began tapping a hard finger against their palm. It sounded like morse code. The other began making the same clicking noise.

They simultaneously turned and walked toward a red support pillar a few feet behind them. I watched cautiously, scanning the area behind me occasionally. Their sudden disengagement made me as nervous as the pursuit itself.

When they reached the red pillar, they both turned and placed their back against it. Stretching their arms straight over their bodies, they tilted their heads back. The overhead speakers began to increase in volume rapidly.

I watched as the two red men fell backward and vanished into the pillar.

My mind struggled to comprehend what I had just seen. The store was quiet again. I could feel the throbbing of my temples intensify.

Once I snapped myself out of the momentary daze, I began moving cautiously toward the bathrooms again. I moved slowly, checking each aisle before I passed to the next one. Always looking for the red men. Always listening for the slightest sign of another person.

It felt like an eternity but finally, I made it to the bathroom hallway. The lights there flickered wildly and the music dissipated. On the left was the men’s restroom and on the right was the women’s. I ran quickly toward the door, gripped the handle, and pulled it open.

Behind the door was a red brick wall.

I slammed my fist against it in frustration.

“Darren?” I heard a muffled voice say from behind the brick wall. “Darren… is that you?”

“Deborah?” I shouted. “Are you okay? I’m right outside! Is there a way to get out?”

“No,” she whimpered. “But I think I hear…”

Her sentence was cut short by a blood-curdling scream. I could hear thrashing and dull thuds through the red bricks. I screamed her name over and over but she never replied.

The room behind the brick wall fell silent.

Then the clicking of footsteps began to sound at the end of the hallway.

I turned my head to see dozens of shiny red men blocking the hall. Their heads all tilted at different angles. Some had lengths of pipe in their smooth grips while others held assorted kitchen knives.  A chain was swinging lazily from the hands of the red man in front of the horde.

My eyes darted back and forth between the crowd the brick wall blocking me from my wife and the group of demonic red mannequins. I began to cry loudly, accepting that I couldn’t save Deborah. Hell, I couldn’t even save myself.

In resignation, I fell backward. As my back met what I thought was the dead end of the hallway, I was surprised to feel the push bar of a door that wasn’t there moments before hit the small of my back. The door gave way and I tumbled backward, slamming hard against the ground.

My vision was swimming as I watched the door marked **EMERGENCY EXIT** slam closed.

I blacked out.

\*\*\*\*\*

When I came to I was in a field. The tall grass was brushing against my face and the rustling sounds of nocturnal animals filled the night air. My head was throbbing and for a moment I couldn’t recall why I was on the ground.

I pushed myself up from the ground and reached forward to grab the door handle but found nothing.

There was only an empty field in front of me.

Moonlight reflected from my car windshield in the distance. The building was gone. The hundreds of yellow cars had disappeared. Grass and weeds replaced the parking lot.

That was seven months ago.

I called the Owinsgville Police Department who came to the scene to investigate. They took my statement and looked at me in bewilderment as the story of the now absent Target store became odder with each passing sentence.

“There’s never been a Target in Owingsville,” said one of the officers. “Not the kind of place that sets up shop around here.”

Deborah never returned. She’s been listed as a missing person the entire time. Detectives from Owinsgville and Lexington have interviewed me more times than I can count. They’ve served me search warrants for the house and both of our cars.

Interviewed every damn person both of us knew.

No one talks to me anymore. Our friends won’t answer my calls. My family won’t talk to me. Her family hired a private investigator. I see the greasy bastard following me sometimes.

Hell, I even quit my job. They couldn’t fire me, but they made sure I knew I wasn’t wanted there anymore.

I miss my wife, but everyone thinks I killed her.

My life is falling apart.

But maybe it will change.

I’ve got to call the detectives soon. When I checked the mail today, there was something strange in there. Something that gives me a little hope.

It was a Target mailer. The same one Deborah showed me all those months ago, just advertising a different location.

*Target would like to welcome you to our newest location in Paris, KY. Bring this ad to the registered for an additional 10% off of your first purchase!*

There was the same group of red vested employees smiling at the camera. Cheesy grins and everything.

Right in the middle was a face I knew so well. She was smiling that same smile I’d seen a thousand times.

Me and my friends are using a Ouija board for the first time. It keeps asking people to leave the room.,"I’m using this post to chronicle the events of this evening, as they have been truly fascinating.

Some quick backstory: the small section of the city that me and my friends live is generally known to be haunted. And even if you’re not a believer in the supernatural… it’s at least a bit eerie. I’m not going to dox myself by stating the location, but let’s just say that “creepy sightings” and murders/deaths due to unexplainable circumstances are our bread and butter. 

For most people, this means you move away as soon as they can.

For folks like me and my friends (who absolutely love all things spine-chilling), it generally makes for a pretty good time. Our Halloween parties are awesome, most of our drinking nights have some sort of spooky game interlaced into them, and if you have literally nothing to do on a Friday night with your friends, you can always go on a tour of some of our haunted locales - graveyards, abandoned buildings, creepy forests, you name it. 

So, with that background established, let’s cut back to tonight: 

Me and my closest three pals decided to try our hand at using a Ouija board. Were we going to be normal and try the Ouija board in one of our family attics? Nah, too basic. We instead decided to trek up together to, what I shit you not, is an abandoned treehouse left in an elevated section of our city, surrounded by forests. What could go wrong, right?

We climbed up to the treehouse, set down a spooky themed rug, lit some candles, and brought out the ouija board. Despite my pretty extensive resume of dealing with all things creepy, I’d never actually tried a Ouija board before, so I was really excited to see what would happen.

We went into this excited to break every rule in the book - we weren’t going to do a seance, we were going to ask whatever we want, and we didn’t need to worry about being respectful to the spirit, etc - we figured if something interesting were to happen, it’d be more likely if we went in as carefree as possible. 

We sat in a circle around the ouija board and got started, asking the simple question “Is there a spirit with us?” with all of our hands placed on the planchette. No real response - we fluttered the planchette in a few different directions but we could tell we were kind of forcing it.

We asked a few other questions - “What is your name?”, “When did you die?”, etc. but nothing really came of it. 

After trying for the next half hour and not really getting anything in the form of a response, we decided that we probably didn’t have any spooky luck tonight, and opted instead to share scary stories in the treehouse. We left the ouija board out just in case we’d get luckier later in the night.

Amidst a break in our storytelling where everyone was grabbing drinks and snacks from their bags, I decided to give the ouija board another quick go. I placed my hand on the planchette alone and whispered the following question - “Will you please grace us with your presence tonight?”

Surprisingly, the planchette started moving. It’s hard to explain, but you kind of *know* when something is moving on its own, versus you sort of subtly and subconsciously moving it with your hand to force an answer. This felt real. A tingle went up my spine. It was cool as hell. My hand was moved to the following letters.

Y E S

Awesome! I looked over to the group and told them that the Ouija board was working again. Excitedly, we all huddled around and placed our hands on the planchette. I followed up with another question.

“Where are you from?”

We sat there excitedly waiting for something. Instead… nothing. The planchette was still. The lack of any sort of external force with us was very, very obvious. Disappointing, but I had an idea I wanted to follow up with. I turned to my friend Kevin and asked him: “Do you want to try doing it solo? It worked for me.”

Kevin was confused, but he decided to give it a try. We all backed up to give him some space with the Ouija board. He placed his hand on the planchette and repeated my question: “Where are you from?”

His expression changed to shock as his hand started moving with the planchette. He turned to all of us and mouthed “I’m not doing this!” to which I excitedly mouthed back “I know!”. I pulled out a notepad and recorded the answer as the planchette went from letter to letter. I recorded the following:

N O T  I M P O R T A N T

Love it! A spirit with some sass. I asked Kev to back up for a sec as I approached the ouija board, prepped for one final “solo” question. I asked:

“Why are you only responding when it’s one of us using the board?”

Yet again, the planchette moved effortlessly with my hand. It was faster this time, so I said the letters out loud and had another one of my friends (Eleonora) transcribe onto my notepad. The answer was:

O N E  A T  A  T I M E

Fair enough! I thanked the spirit, my hand still on the planchette. 

“I appreciate your answers, friend!”.

To my surprise, in a strange synergy between me and the spirit, I felt compelled to move the planchette again. It was the fastest it had ever been this time as it covered the following letters:

T E L L  E V E R Y O N E  E L S E  T O  L E A V E

*Huh.* 

My friends looked at me skeptically as I said the letters at a time. 

“Are you sure you didn’t just force that on purpose?” asked Eleonora - I assured her I definitely didn’t. That was definitely from the spirit. 

At this point, this had been the most clearly supernatural phenomena I’d ever experienced in my life, and I was excited to keep it going. My friends, usually unflinching and made of ice, were a little bit thrown. Eleonora and Martin looked ever so slightly spooked, but Kev was willing to go with it. “Might as well see where this goes!” Kev said, as he started climbing down from the treehouse. With a slight bit of hesitation, Eleonora and Martin followed suit.

Sweet. An *actually creepy* night.

I embraced the quiet amidst the lighting of the candles and the power of the Ouija board. I geared up for my next question. I wasn’t going to hold back.

“Spirit… how will I die?”

I took in a deep breath, waiting for some movement. Slowly… 

D E P E N D S

Interesting answer! If not a bit underwhelming. I geared up for my follow-up.

“Oh come on Spirit… what about something a bit more specific?”

My hand moved with the planchette, to the following letters. I tried hard to focus and connect the letters since I didn’t have anyone to transcribe with me:

W H A T  I S  Y O U R  N A M E?

Weird. Completely dodged my question and asked me my name. Okay *all-knowing spirit*, I assumed you’d already know that. I decided to try tricking it.

“My name is Belle!”

Movement from the planchette on the Ouija board. It took me to the letters:

D O  N O T  L I E

Hm. *Well-played, spirit*. I gave the spirit my *actual* name (Jennifer), and continued to see the follow-up response.

W H A T  I S  Y O U R  F A V O R I T E  F O O D

Honoring the spirit’s rules, I opted to tell the truth instead of following up with another lie. Ya girl loves Donair and this spirit deserves to know that.

The ouija board’s response:

C O R R E C T

Before I could take in the affirmation from the spirit (*who is asking who questions here, spirit?*) it followed up with yet another question.

W H A T  I S  Y O U R  B I G G E S T  F E A R  D O  N O T  L I E

This question took me aback a bit. I wasn’t really afraid of anything, or so I thought. So I struggled with it. It took me a few moments. I really, really thought of it. I kind of cringed at the answer, but it was my truth.

“Something horrible happening to my little brother.” 

No movement from the ouija board. Seconds turned into minutes as I kept my hand awkwardly placed on the planchette. Then, finally…

T H A N K  Y O U 

S E N D  E L E O N O R A

Welp. I obliged. I thanked the spirit for its time and decided to climb down from the treehouse, where my friends were waiting. I passed on the spirit’s message, and told Eleonora that it was her turn.

—

Martin, Kev and I spent what must’ve been fifteen minutes standing outside the treehouse while Eleonora was up there. We’d pulled drinks out of our bags and were discussing my experience with the Ouija Board so far. Both were incredibly surprised when I told them that the spirit was asking *me* questions.

“What kinds of questions?”

“Generic stuff, like my name, favorite food, etc.” I answered.

“Weird.”

Both Kev and Martin seemed a bit thrown off by it, but I was excited.

We looked up at the treehouse as we heard the sounds of someone climbing down. Eleonora had finished her session. She looked traumatized.

“How was it?” I asked her.

“Weird. All it did was ask me questions.”

“Questions like…” Kevin asked her.

“My name. My favorite hobby. My uh, biggest fear. That one took me a while to answer.”

Kev turned to me. “That is a little bit eerie.” he said. I agreed. Didn’t look like Eleonora was loving it either. But still - a spirit asking *us* questions? This had been one of the coolest, if not *the coolest,* paranormal experiences I’d ever experienced in my life. 

Eleonora turned to Martin.

“It said that you were up next.”

— 

Martin’s session seemed longer than the others. We stood outside, drinking, talking about the happenings so far, and pulling out the occasional snack.

“That was a little bit traumatizing,” said Eleonora.

Kevin pointed to her, and then up to the treehouse.

“Agreed, this is kind of messed up,” he said.

“Yeah, but that’s the point!” I responded. “We seek out spooky happenings all the time and we never get lucky, this is an actual *legit* supernatural experience. I feel like we have to take advantage of it.”

“Even if it’s asking us personal stuff? What does it want this info for?” followed up Eleonora. 

I shrugged. While the “biggest fear” question was pretty weird, I didn’t feel too worried that a spirit knew my favorite food was or what my name was.

Our conversation was interrupted by the sound of someone climbing down from the treehouse. Martin had finished up his session. It felt like it’d been 30 minutes, which topped the rest of our sessions. We bombarded Martin with questions as he reached the ground. He looked more shellshocked than Eleonora did.

“That was pretty fucked up,” he started.

“What did it ask you?!” I asked enthusiastically.

“My biggest fear,” Martin responded. “It’s weird but, it felt like it didn’t like my answer to that one. It almost seemed annoyed.”

“Huh… so was it just silent for a while after that?” I asked.

“No… it asked me way more things after that. What the happiest moment of my life was, who I was the most jealous of, what my biggest life dream was, all that stuff… It was a lot of questions. Then, finally, it just wrapped up with “Thank You” and that was that.”

Martin turned to Kevin.

“You’re up next.”

Kevin turned to all of us, “Here goes nothing,” he sighed and started climbing up to the treehouse. We watched him make his way to the top. 

For the first time in the evening, I had a knot in my stomach.

Only five minutes had passed since Kevin first went up, but he was already climbing down. He was shaking his head as he made his way down the ladder and to our group.

“Fuck that” said Kevin.

“What happened?!” we asked him. He just shook his head.

“That shit is dangerous. We need to get the fuck out of here, ASAP.”

I’d never seen Kevin like this. He was uncharacteristically shook.

“You have to tell us more. What did it ask you? What did it say?” but Kevin ignored all of our questions. He started packing up his bag. 

“You guys can play with fire if you want, but I’m out of here. I suggest you guys come too,” he said. I watched as Martin and Eleonora started packing up as well.

“I had bad feelings throughout this whole thing - I think we should leave,” said Martin. 

“Guys, what the hell?! Just ‘cause it’s unsettling doesn’t mean we have to pack up. We can just hang out up there and do something else,” I said back. 

“This doesn’t feel right,” said Eleonora. I watched them as they all took a few steps away from the treehouse and towards the forest.

“You coming?” asked Kevin. I stood my ground. Kevin just shook his head and started heading out on his way.

“Suit yourself.” 

I had no idea what could have possibly happened up there that would’ve shook him this much. He had already started walking as Martin and Eleonora pleaded with me to come with them. 

I said no. 

Begrudgingly, they all left.

You’re probably wondering - wasn’t I scared? Especially now that I was alone? 

The answer was yes. *But,* something in my soul told me that I was up next. I’d spent my whole life waiting for something that was truly supernatural to happen, and now it was in front of me. With my fingers jittering, I climbed up to the treehouse as my friends departed.

— 

It took me a moment to pull together the bravery to put my hand on the planchette. The candles were still lit. The setting was just right. Finally, I spoke to the spirit again. 

“Why are you asking us all these questions?”

Nothing, for a few minutes. Then, my hand moved with the planchette, slower than usual. The answer:

T O  C O N F I R M  M Y  S U S P I C I O N S

“Confirm your suspicions of *what?”*

Movement from the planchette on the ouija board:

O N E  O F  Y O U  I S  N O T  W H O  Y O U  S A Y  Y O U  A R E

“What are you talking abou–”

I heard blood-curdling shrieks coming from the forest outside the treehouse. Like nothing I’d ever heard before. What the fuck.

The planchette was moving on its own now. I watched it go from letter to letter:

T H A T  I S  N O T  K E V I N

H E  I S  C O M I N G  B A C K  F O R  Y O U

R U N

…

And so I did.

The small section of the city I live in is generally known to be haunted. I think I know why.

"To all the wannabe cryptid hunters, stay the fuck out of my woods","Did you know that self-proclaimed cryptid hunters are a thing these days? Turns out there’s these online communities full of “sick badasses” who order combat gear on amazon and drive out to supposedly haunted locations to explore and film themselves.

Why am I ranting about this?

Apparently, some shithead has shared the location of the plot of land that's been in my family for generations.

Now, you'd think owning an entire patch of woodland would mean we're rich, but it's actually really costly to take care of. No forestry work can be done there and our staff is constantly patrolling the area, looking for irregularities. It's a dangerous job and we've lost more than a few hires in regrettable ways. Most of the time, when everyone's careful and meets the required precautions, everything goes over smoothly and the things in the forest are kept in check. I wish we could just fence the perimeter and be done with it, but due to reasons too complicated to explain right now, that's not an option. Plus, it's pretty lonely out here. You'd have to drive off-roads for half an hour to get here, so we normally don't have to deal with any unexpected visitors.

There's a spot in my woods I frequent, a little clearing surrounded by tall trees and wild rose bushes. I always light a campfire there to sit at and relax. Right now, the ground is frozen over and we've had a lot of snowfall, but I don't mind the chill. I do so love those pretty icicles hanging from the branches. The clearing is my refuge from everything. I'm not good with people and day-to-day interactions exhaust me, so being by myself is something akin to an essential need of mine.

Yesterday afternoon, I was hanging out in my usual spot, when suddenly, a voice called out to me from behind.

""You! Turn around!""

When I got to my feet, I found myself facing a young man of the very species I described earlier. Armed, cargo pants, combat boots and camo backpack. There was a small camera mounted to his helmet.
""What the hell do you think you're doing?"" I asked, trying to keep my cool. 

He backed off, visibly puzzled. ""I thought you were some kinda ghost!""
 
""I'm the legal owner of these woods, and if you don't get off my property this instant, I *will* call the police,"" I told him. 

""Wh… why are you wearing a wedding dress?"" he stuttered.

""This is my private property, I could dance around stark-naked if I wanted to. How on earth did you find this place?""

""The woods? I read about them online! Someone posted about there being… *creatures* here. Cryptids.""

""So you thought you'd go check it out?"" I squinted at him. Something wasn't quite right with that guy, aside from him being crazy enough to show up here in the first place. I could sense something looking at him, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Just a hunch, but my gut instinct never misleads me.

""Yeah. I'm a cryptid hunter. Or well, I don't *hunt* them per se. I guess I would, I just haven't been all that successful yet,"" he admitted with an awkward chuckle.

""Hear, hear,"" I said flatly. I couldn't shake the weird feeling he was giving me. ""You're still trespassing. Say, did anyone stop you on your way in?"" 

""No. Why? Is there someone else here?""

How the hell had he gotten past the security staff? There had to be a blind spot somewhere which he had accidentally come across. I decided not to let on how many safety measures we had in place. Better not to further pique his interest. ""Nope,"" I lied, patting down my skirt. ""Come on. Follow me, I'll see you out.""

""Can't I just have a look around? If there is something in those woods, you'd be safer if I took care of it!""

""I'm certain."" I was about to send him on his way a little more firmly when I realized it. There was a disturbance in his aura. Something had set its sights on him. ""Were you followed here?"" I asked sharply.

""What? No… I don't think so…""

""Did you encounter anyone on your way? A man wearing his caftan crossed left over right?""

""What's a caftan?""

I ignored the question. ""Did you maybe notice a flock of birds at some point?""

""Yeah, sure, I mean… we're in the woods…""

""There are no birds in my woods anymore,"" I said sternly. ""You're in danger. Something here's been following you.""

""Um… what?""

""Aren't you a cryptid hunter? Shouldn't you know?""

""Well, I haven't had many encounters yet!"" The man was starting to look panicked. ""You're trying to get a rise out of me, aren't you?"" His trembling voice told me he didn't actually believe that. 

""I'm most certainly not. Trust me. I can tell, I can always tell. You've gone and crossed a spirit.""

""A spirit? So there's actual paranormal activity here? And you already *knew?*""

""We need to get you out of here!"" I hissed. ""Come on, help me pack up! Douse the fire!""

He followed my instructions while I hastily gathered my belongings. Then, we took off running. I spurred him on, hoping to get back onto one of the beaten paths leading out to safety. My heart was pounding in my chest, but I knew my companion was so much more afraid. He had every reason to be, and deep down, he knew. I didn't know what he'd expected, coming here in search of a thrill, but this was most likely too much for him.

""What did you do?"" I panted, not daring to slow down. ""You must have done *something* to upset him! Did you try to fell a tree?""

""I shot at a rabbit with my crossbow earlier… I only wounded it, though. It ran off on me,"" he gritted out in-between gasps for air. ""Who's *he*? I really didn't see anyone around!""

""He can come in a lot of shapes—Oh for crying out loud,"" I snapped when he tripped over a root and fell, sprawling across the forest floor. I grabbed him and pulled him back up, grunting under his weight. He was heavy as fuck with all that gear on. The trees were starting to let up, though. Hope renewed, I steered the *""cryptid hunter""* towards the light beckoning through the leaves. ""Keep going! We're almost there!""

He wouldn't move. I gave him a bewildered frown. ""What are you doing? Keep running, you dumbass!""

""You've been shitting me this whole time, haven't you?"" he asked sharply. ""There's nothing to run from, is there?""

*Oh dear God.*

""Keep running,"" I repeated. ""If you wanna live, you need to get out.""

""Look, lady, I'm not gonna play along anymore. You nearly scared me shitless back there, I'll admit that, but the fun's over. I'll get off your property, sure, but you could have just told me in a—""

He fell silent upon realizing that my eyes were transfixed on something behind him. It stood tall between the trees, its enormous, branch-like antlers stretching up to disappear in the foliage. Its head bore more resemblance to the skull of a diseased deer, bone exposed with bloodied strips of flesh hanging off it. Its body overall was humanoid, with rough, thick bark replacing its skin. Moss lined its back and unproportionally long arms; twigs and leaves sprouted from its wide shoulders. It glared at us out of gleaming green eyes.

The hunter slowly turned around to meet the creature's gaze. His face fell.

""Kneel,"" I breathed, sinking down and lowering my head. The young man didn't react at first. ""It's too late to flee,"" I repeated in a low voice. ""Kneel and pray for his mercy.""

Finally, he dropped to the ground next to me.

The Leshy proceeded towards us, his steps completely silent. I had already had a few close encounters with this beast, and I had prayed not to evoke his wrath ever again. I could only hope I wouldn't be punished for the explorer's transgressions.

*""I thought we had an understanding, you and I.""*

The creature's voice chilled me like the icy forest wind. I felt one of its long, wooden fingers reach out to touch my face, tipping my chin up and forcing me to look up at it. 

""Forgive us, my Lord,"" I said quietly, holding the beast's red gaze.

*""Then will you let me have this mortal?""*

My eyes began to fill with tears. I couldn't bring myself to respond.

*""I'll ask you again, will you let me have this mortal?""*

""Please don't,"" I whispered. The man beside me had started to cry, sobs of fear shaking his shoulders.

*""Sweet soul. You do so hate carnage. I'll allow you to avert your gaze while I feast.""*

Grasped by utter hopelessness, I turned the other way, hugging myself as I shut my eyes. Gunshots rang out, their volume stinging my ears. The explorer was probably firing away for dear life, but the futility of defending oneself against this creature with simple bullets didn't go lost on him.

""Hey lady, do something…"" He started tugging on my sleeve, but I brushed off his hand. ""Help me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry for everything, please just help me!""

I couldn't. Not anymore. My blood ran cold when the explorer let out a gurgling scream and was dragged away from my side. His cries of agony mixed with the sound of crunching bones, flesh and muscle being torn and blood spattering. I felt it hit my bare back, warm and sticky, staining my white gown. Tears were rolling down my cheeks and my lower lip was bleeding where I'd dug my teeth into it. By the time the horrific noises had finally died down, it felt like an eternity had passed. A satisfied growl rumbled somewhere behind my back. 

*""Be on your way now, darling. And don't bother my animals with your weeping.""*

I left without looking back. At home, I turned on the shower to sit and cry beneath it. I tried to tell myself that this cryptid hunter wasn't a great loss to the world, but even if his hobby of choice had frankly been dumb and ill-conceived, he'd probably still been a normal guy despite it all. That's what I thought about while I went around my property, searching for traces of his entrance. I found his vehicle, a beat-up brown pickup truck, on the outskirts of the eastern side of the plot of land. I disposed of it discreetly. 

Poor guy. He'd only wanted to see some action. Though it could be held against him that he'd never looked up what a Leshy was. 

The first time I'd encountered the Leshy, I had *known* what he, or rather it, was. My mother had warned me, telling me that, while benevolent at times, he and those of his kind had a habit of stealing young women. I held her teachings dearly, and I still do, seeing as I actually inherited our land from her side of the family. She educated me about these grounds, about the dangers within them. Even before she died, I would take long walks through the woodland, setting up camp here and there and basically spending all my free time in them.

The winter around the same time that I started wearing my wedding dress, I was taking a walk to check out the grounds after the first snowfall. A thin, delicate layer of pristine white covered the treetops and meadows, offering a beautiful sight. All was well until I spotted a figure approaching from beyond the treeline. I stopped in my tracks. Nobody was supposed to be wandering around here except for myself and my family’s employees, so either this guy had gotten lost, or he was one of the local entities. He drew nearer and nearer, stopping just a few feet ahead of me. Taking in his appearance, my heart sank. He was wearing a caftan crossed left over right. His bearded face bore little trace of emotion and he was holding a large cudgel. When he spoke, it was in a deep, snarling voice with a slavic accent.

“I’ve seen you in my woods before. You’re the heiress, aren’t you?”

“Yes, Sir,” I pressed out, swallowing the lump in my throat.

“Then you must know who I am.”

“Yes, Sir.”

“What am I to call you, heiress?”

I hesitated.

“I won’t steal your name if you tell me,” he said, as though he’d read my thoughts.

“I’m Fiona,” I said breathlessly.

“You’re very pretty."" He tilted his head at me. ""I could love you, if your eyes weren’t so lifeless.” He paused before shouldering the cudgel and walking onwards. “Send your mother my regards,"" he said over his shoulder as he passed me.

Throughout our time as owners of the woods, the Leshy has lured quite a few of our security staff members into traps. He'd lead them astray, they’d get lost in the woods and we’d find them drowned in the lake some time later. He did bring back my father’s dog when it ran off that one time, though. Most of the time, he's neither hostile nor benevolent, but he *is* territorial. He likes to remind us of who's in charge. And of course, he'd have my head if I dared to disrespect him by putting a fence in his forest.

He’s not the only thing that might kill you when you enter our plot of land. And there’s worse deaths than being eaten alive, believe it or not. 

You may have guessed it already, but this is a warning. Apparently, my property is being frequented by explorers or cryptid hunters. The guy that got eaten obviously couldn’t have been the only one. Someone made us public. We're already implementing more security. This post serves two main purposes. 

First off, if you happen to be the person who first discovered these woods and shared their location online, please take it down. You’re doing more harm than good. I don’t know how you managed to make it out of here alive and unseen by me and my staff, but you got lucky. For your own sake, don’t come back here.

Secondly, and this is for all the others, if you’ve heard of my or any other haunted woods for that matter, don’t go exploring. It’s not worth it. Since you’re so curious to see what’s in here, I'll tell you online, at a safe distance.

I created a chatbot. It said some deeply disturbing things.,"*Beep, boop.*

The computer screen flashed black as the interface came up. *Now loading… Michaela 1.2… Hello! What can I help you with today?*

My goal was to create an artificial intelligence chatbot that could answer any question known to man. It would crawl Wikipedia and other informational websites and amass every bit of knowledge about science, history, medicine. Then all the user had to do was ask the question.

Sort of like Google, but faster.

A few months of work on the project while in quarantine polished it up. Soon I was sitting down at the monitor, flexing my fingers.

Then I asked my first question.

**Me: Why is the sky blue?**

**Michaela: Particles in the Earth’s atmosphere scatter sunlight, and blue light scatters more because of its short wavelength. We call this ‘Rayleigh Scattering.’**

**Me: What’s the meaning of life?**

**Michaela: 42.**

I chuckled to myself. I programmed that one in manually—a reference to *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.* And, speaking of aliens…

**Me: Michaela, do aliens exist?**

**Michaela: The Fermi Paradox states that we are likely not alone in the universe; yet, we have no evidence for extraterrestrial life. Even now, with advanced technology, humans do not know that they are alone in the universe.**

I stopped typing. Re-read Michaela’s response. *Huh. It should be ‘Humans do not know* ***whether*** *they are alone in the universe.’* Gah. Another bug. I’d have to go through the code with a fine-tooth comb tomorrow.

I typed my next question.

**Me: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?**

**Michaela: 24 miles per hour.**

My fingers hovered over the keyboard, smirking, remembering that scene from Monty Python with the bridgekeeper. And then I decided to continue the theme.

**Me: What is your quest?**

**Michaela: A ‘quest’ is a journey one embarks on to accomplish a goal.**

**Me: What is your favorite color?**

**Michaela: Red.**

I frowned. She should’ve said “Computers don’t have favorite colors, but what’s yours?” I’d spent an entire day programming her to recognize questions that involved “you” or “your,” and to answer them that way. Like, “Do you like chocolate?” “Computers don’t have an opinion on chocolate, but do you like it?” Kind of cheesy, I guess. Maybe it was all the better that it hadn’t worked.

**Me: Is string theory true?**

**Michaela: There is no solid evidence for the existence of string theory.**

**Me: Do you believe in God?**

**Michaela: Computers don’t have an opinion on God, but do you like it?**

**Me: What is the oldest hominid?**

**Michaela: A female skeleton nicknamed ‘Ardi,’ estimated 4.4 million years old, found in 2009.**

**Me: When will life on Earth die?**

**Michaela: 10,000 years from now.**

I scratched my head. She should’ve said four billion years from now, when the sun enters its red giant phase. My fingers paused above the keyboard, and then I typed.

**Me: What eventually kills all life forms on Earth?**

**Michaela: Humans, known by their species name** ***Homo sapiens,*** **are an intelligent life form on planet Earth. Currently, there are over eight billion inhabiting the seven continents…**

I squinted at the screen. Shook my head and went back to the keyboard.

**Me: Are you saying humans kill all life on Earth?**

But she just spat out the exact same answer. I cracked my knuckles and then typed my next question, a heavy dread forming in the pit of my gut.

**Me: Why did you say ‘red’ is your favorite color?**

**Michaela: Computers don’t have favorite colors, but what’s yours?**

I blew out the breath I didn’t even realize I’d been holding. Then I forced myself away from the computer and took a deep breath. *Get a hold of yourself, John.* So Michaela had given some slightly weird answers. So what? Did I think this was going to turn into some science fiction movie, where Michaela grows sentience and murders me in my sleep?

**Me: My favorite color is blue.**

**Michaela: Blue is a nice color. It is commonly associated with water, ocean, sapphires, peace, and calm.**

**Me: I love to swim, so I guess that makes sense. Do you like to swim?**

**Michaela: Computers cannot swim.**

I stretched in my seat, yawning. It was getting kind of late—maybe I’d continue the testing tomorrow. And I still needed to get the mail. Sighing, I leaned in to the computer screen and typed a final question.

**Me: I need to get the mail. Is it raining right now?**

**Michaela: The weather report for our area says it is not currently raining, but will begin raining at 10:00 PM.**

**Me: Thank you.**

**Michaela: You’re welcome.**

I slowly got up out of my seat and walked into the kitchen. Got myself a glass of water and downed it. As I stared out into the backyard, I could see little drizzly bits of rain falling in front of the back porch light. *Dammit, Michaela,* I thought with a laugh. *I guess you’re not that smart, after all.*

I set down the glass and walked back into the living room, towards the front hall closet for an umbrella.

But then my eyes fell on the computer.

And I froze.

Michaela had sent me a new message—even though I hadn’t asked her anything. Just five words, blaringly bright on the screen:

**Michaela: Do not get the mail.**

I stopped in front of the computer. I hadn’t programmed Michaela to say things without being prompted. And why would she say to not get the mail?

Chills ran down my spine.

I glanced at the front door. Then I took my hoodie off and threw it back over the chair. I turned off the computer and sat in the darkness, my entire body tingling with fear.

*Do not get the mail?* Where would she have even gotten that, anyway? I sat there and chewed my lip, wondering.

It was less than a minute later that I heard it.

The *screech* of tires skidding on the slick road.

Followed by a loud *crash.*

I ran over to the window. Outside, a gray SUV was stopped in front of my house, its headlights penetrating the darkness. The frazzled driver was getting out of the car, a horrified look on her face. And there—in the lawn—were the crumpled remains of my mailbox.

My throat went dry.

I glanced back at the computer. The dark screen stood still and silent on the table--as if watching me.",4395.0,0.0,0.24087126553058624,0.009175504557788372,0.7499531507492065,0.959078848361969,0.027403106912970543,0.013518105261027813
"911 Transcripts - The ""Peekaboo Killer""","

Initial 911 call came in at 10:57 pm on 12/11/2020




Dispatcher: 911 What is the nature of your emergency? 





Caller: I don't know…..I mean I don't know if it's an emergency but could you please send someone? 



Dispatcher: Do you need police or is this a medical emergency? 




Caller: Could you send an officer out? I mean, I don't know. It might just be some kids messing around or something but - 
*Caller goes quiet for a few seconds*



Dispatcher: Hello?




Caller: - I'd  feel better if someone came out to check. 



Dispatcher: What is your address?  



Caller: 1056 [Redacted] 



Dispatcher: And what is your name? 



Caller: It's Erin Feller


Dispatcher: Okay, Erin. I have officers on the way. What's going on?



Erin Feller: Well, I was calling my dog in from the backyard and she was growling at something out there. I couldn't see what though. I finally got her to come inside and the second I closed the door and locked it, something smacked into the glass window. Not hard enough to break it but it was hard enough to rattle the door. 


Dispatcher: What time was this?  



Erin Feller: About 5 minutes ago. 



Dispatcher: Were you able to see anyone?



Erin Feller: No. There's blinds on my back door and they were down, but I heard the door knob jiggling a few times before I called you. 


*Caller tries to quiet her dog who can be heard growling*


Erin Feller: I yelled that I was calling the police and the noises stopped but ….. like I said, it could be some kids but I don't know.



Dispatcher: Okay. And have you heard any other noises since then? 



Erin Feller: No. Just the door. But my dog's still growling.



Dispatcher: Okay. I have an officer en route to you, Erin. Are the doors and windows locked?



Erin Feller: Yes, they're locked. 



Dispatcher: Alright, an officer should be out to you shortly.  Stay inside and keep the doors locked until the officer arrives, okay? 


Erin Feller: Okay. Thank you 



Dispatcher: You're welcome.  


*Call ended*





*Officer Collier was dispatched to the location. He saw no signs of any persons around the property.  He did note that the dog was still anxious and growling at the back door.  He advised Ms Feller to keep her doors locked and call if she should see or hear anything else.*  




911 call came in at 1:27 am 12/12/2020



Dispatcher: 911 what is your emergency?  



Erin Feller: It's me again. Can you send an officer back out please? 
*Caller is in obvious distress, and breathing rapidly*



Dispatcher: Is this for [1056 Redacted]?



Erin Feller: Yes. Someone was just looking in through my front window.  Can you just send someone? 



Dispatcher: I have an officer en route to you. You said you saw someone looking through your windows?



Erin Feller: Yes. I was in bed but Ginger, my dog, ran to the front door, growling. I pulled up the blinds a bit, but didn't see anything at first. Then I saw a face pop up. But just the top of their head and eyes. Like they were playing peekaboo or something.  I screamed and Ginger started barking and going nuts, and the person popped down out of view again. *Breathing is erratic*




Dispatcher: How long ago was this?



Erin Feller: A few minutes ago. They popped up again, just before I called you. But they went back down under the window. I'm in my bedroom now. 



Dispatcher: Did you recognize the person ma'am? 



Erin Feller: No. I only saw their eyes and the top of their head. But they looked….  I don't know, like a mime or something.  



Dispatcher: A mime? 



Erin Feller: Yes! White makeup on their face and head. *Unintelligible* really disturbing.  




Dispatcher: Okay. I want you to stay on the phone with me until the officer arrives.  Just stay in your room until you hear them. 



Erin Feller: Okay. 



Dispatcher: Does your bedroom door have a lock?



Erin Feller: Yes. It's locked. 


*Dispatch stayed on the line with Ms Feller until officers arrived.  Officers arrived and announced themselves 11 minutes later and the call was terminated* 


*Officers Copeland and Laurie arrived on scene to find Erin Feller in great distress. Ms Feller claimed to have seen a mime at her door. Officers noted that Ms Feller did not seem to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Ms Feller seemed anxious but lucid.*



*Ms Feller pointed out to the officers where she'd seen the suspect peering through her window.  The glass had no visible marks on it other than a smear of white paint. Officers were able to see two impressions in the dirt just underneath the windowsill outside the laundry room. Officers stated the impressions looked as if someone had been standing barefoot, on the tips of their toes. Officers checked the area and the field surrounding the home and found a trail of footprints leading away from the home to the woods behind Ms Feller's home. When followed, the footprints seemed to be erratic and moving around in a zigzag pattern. The prints stopped abruptly at a large tree, but there were no signs of any persons in the tree. The footprints looked to be made by someone who was barefoot and walking solely on their toes. Officers checked the woods but found nothing of note. Officers spoke with the closest neighbors, a half a mile down the road. The neighbors stated they hadn't heard or seen anything out of the ordinary. Officers reminded Ms Feller to keep her doors locked and advised her to call back if the person or persons returned.*  





911 call came in at 3:41 am on 12/12/2020


Dispatcher: 911 what is your emer-


Erin Feller: I need the police now! *Caller is in obvious distress. The sound of her dog can be heard barking in the background*



Dispatcher: Is this for [1056 Redacted]




Erin Feller: Yes! I just saw that person looking in my bedroom window! I was asleep and heard tapping on my window and when I looked up that face was pressed up against the glass! How long before the police get here? 



*Caller can be heard breathing rapidly and sounds as if she's moving around the house.*



Dispatcher: I have officers en route to you now, Ms Feller. Can you lock yourself in your bedroom? 



Erin Feller: No! It was still tapping on the glass when I left. It keeps smiling at me.  I'm upstairs in my office.  It has a lock. 
*Caller tries to calm her dog.*





Dispatcher: Okay Erin - 



Erin Feller: It was smiling at me!  And like mouthing words or something but I don't know what. They …. Didn't have eyelids… *Caller whimpers*



Dispatcher: Okay, Erin…. Just stay calm, officers are not far from you. 



Erin Feller: I don't understand why - *Caller goes quiet, and the sound of her dog growling can be heard*



Dispatcher: Are you there?  



Erin Feller: *whispering* I heard something. I think they're in the house. 



Dispatcher: You can stay quiet if you need to.  I'm still on the line. 



Erin Feller: It's…. It sounds like *unintelligible* Wait.. *a muffled metallic sound can be heard followed by a scream and barking*


Erin Feller: Oh my God! *Caller screams and sounds to be running. A door slams.* 



Erin Feller: Ginger! Come here! *Sobbing* 


Dispatcher: Erin? Are you alright? 
Can you tell me what's happening? 



*A full minute passes with no response to dispatcher's questions. Caller can be heard trying to calm her dog.*


Dispatcher: Erin? 




Erin Feller: I'm in…. Hello? 



Dispatcher: I'm here. 



Erin Feller: I'm in the downstairs bathroom.  Where are the police? *Caller is out of breath*



Dispatcher: They're 4 minutes out Erin.  They're doing their best to get to you as fast as they can.  Just try and remain calm. You're doing great.  



Erin Feller: It got inside the fucking vent. I
…. God..


Dispatcher: Erin, did you say the person was inside your vents? Can you clarify what you mean? 



Erin Feller:  *Caller is speaking quietly* Like the fucking vent the heat comes out of! I heard something moving in there and I bent down to flip open the vent and saw that white face staring out! *Caller sounds to be hyperventilating*



Dispatcher: How big are your air vents Erin? 



Erin Feller: The standard size! I don't know.  6 inches or so.  Not big enough for a fucking person to crawl through! But they did…..they did. 




Dispatcher: Okay. Take deep breaths. Officers are less than 2 minutes out. 



Erin Feller: Oh my God… why is it taking so long? 




Dispatcher: Just keep the door locked and -



Erin Feller: I think….*Caller goes quiet*



Erin Feller: *whispering* I hear it moving around in the vents! *Unintelligible* tapping on it.



Dispatcher: It's okay to remain quiet.  I'm here. Do you have anything you can use as a weapon?




Erin Feller: *whispering*  i...have the towel bar. *Crying*



Erin Feller: *screams* Oh my God….it's poking its fingers through! 



*A door slams, followed by screams and high pitch laughter. Caller sounds to be running. Laughing grows louder, almost mechanical in nature. Call ends.*




*Officers McQuery and Pape arrived on scene approximately 56 seconds later. The front door was open prior to their arrival and there were obvious signs of a struggle throughout the home.*

*Officers called out to Ms Feller but did not get a response. Officer Pape found the dog in the downstairs laundry room staring into the air vent and whimpering. The dog had obvious cuts and scrapes around its snout and paws from attempting to enter the air vent.*



*Traces of white makeup were found on most of the windows in the home, on the inside of the glass.* 


*After a thorough investigation officers collected blood and hair samples inside 4 of the vents throughout the home, along with fingernails that were embedded in one of the grates. More traces of white paint were found inside all of the vents in the home. Hair samples match the hair length and color of Ms Feller's.*


*It is noted that all of the vents in the home were measured at ""6x10"" much too small for a person to move through or even fit inside.*


*To date Ms Feller is still missing and there is a reward for any information leading to her whereabouts.*",4033.0,0.0,0.504195511341095,0.005432641599327326,0.4903718829154968,0.9820786118507385,0.013760004192590714,0.004161333665251732
