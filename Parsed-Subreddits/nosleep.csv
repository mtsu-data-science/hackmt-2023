Warnings to the wannabe cryptid hunters: There was something in the sky,,363.0,0.0,,,"You'd think I wouldn't be able to sleep after having the literal Devil house under my bed, but I actually found the part of the night that followed very restful. Maybe all the excitement had exhausted me. To my surprise, no alarm clock rang me out of bed the following day. I was tickled awake by the gentle rays of winter sunlight falling in through my window. I admittedly felt a little like a Disney princess. Someone had drawn the curtains open and tucked my blanket closer around me—I noticed it as soon as I opened my eyes. A fuzzy warmth spread in my chest as I swung my legs out of bed and started climbing into my dress. Traipsing down the stairs, I was met with the delicious smell of pancakes. This was… suspiciously pleasant.

Upon entering the kitchen, I found Cas waiting for me, holding out a loaded plate.

""You made breakfast?"" 

His shoulders drooped. ""I was feeling really guilty for how I blew you off yesterday,"" he admitted sheepishly. ""And then I had a really sad, creepy nightmare where you were standing across from me and you were looking at me with your eyes all white and you were crying, and I wanted to comfort you but then all of my teeth fell out… Anyway, I went to wake you up but you looked so peaceful… I ended up turning off your alarm. Figured you'd need the rest. I've already checked up on the morning shift. Everyone seems to be doing alright, although we *will* need a replacement for Hayes sooner rather than later.""

""Didn't you meet some folks who were interested in working here a little while ago? You know, when you went to town.""

""Yeah, but I don't know if we ought to be conducting interviews at a time like this,"" he argued.

""We're gonna have to. We don't have to do it here. We could do it somewhere public. There's a diner there that's not so bad, right?"" 

""That might work."" A sparkle returned to Cas' eyes as he proceeded to douse my pancakes in syrup. ""I hope it was okay that I came into your room. I was missing you a lot. I know that makes me sound like a baby, but—""

""But what are you gonna do,"" I interrupted him casually. ""Sweetie, you're not Jem. And you used to hang out in my room all the time."" I set my plate down on the kitchen table and proceeded to tell him about Nick's visit the night prior. Casimir was shocked, but I assured him that I wasn't letting the Devil's mind games get to me. 

""So aside from that, we've potentially been sitting on what, an eldritch horror that's sleeping somewhere on our property?"" he clarified.

""Seems like it. But on the plus side, all Nick asked me to do is *locate* it. Not to wake it up, not to make contact, just to locate it."" I shrugged. ""I think I can do that.""

""I can run some job interviews on the side!"" my little brother offered readily. 

""I'd appreciate it, but, like… elephant in the room, what do we do about Dad?"" 

Casimir fell silent. ""I seriously don't know. But I'll try to come up with something, I promise. You can't waste your energy worrying about him right now. It's been bad enough for you as of late. I want… I *need* you to be okay. I'm scared for you. Anyone else would have probably gone insane by now.""

I smiled, waving him off. ""Surely not *anyone…*"" 

""Fi, that wasn't some sort of compliment. I think you're *literally* at risk of losing your mind,"" he said sternly. ""Look, I'll try to take care of the Dad-situation. You, do what Nick asked. If we keep him happy, he'll uphold the deal with the huldufólk. Besides, I really don't want him to be pissed at us. He freaks me the fuck out.""

""I know what you mean."" Squirming in my seat, I tried to meet Cas' pale green gaze. ""Okay, I'm not sure if I should be telling you this, but Nick… He kind of *likes* you. He says that once you die, you'll become one of those demons who torture the sinners in Lust. Is that something you wanna do, by any chance?""

From the disgusted look on his face, I could tell that it was probably not. Casimir seemed to be genuinely repulsed by the idea, but his answer was rather level-headed. ""I kinda… I guess I knew. I honestly don't know if I can even change that. And I wouldn't even know how to start trying.""

""Maybe not knock up every other girl you meet?""

He let out a dry chuckle. ""Yeah, that'd be a start. But that's something I've been meaning not to do anymore either way. Fi… I'm not a monster.""

""I know."" I quietly cut off a part of my pancake stack. ""Hey, um… Jeremy said some pretty concerning things. About how you'd understand what he'd done, if you were real with yourself. And that *it was different* for you guys. Any chance you could tell me what he meant by that?""

Casimir shook his head. ""Jem's crazy. Yes, I know what he's talking about, but it's bullshit. Of course we had a shit time as kids, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to go and kill people.""

""A shit time?"" I repeated quizzically.

Cas let go of a deep, ragged breath. ""It's about mom. I think. See, mom was really pretty sucky. Not to you, of course, because she loved *you*, but us? Especially us boys? Well. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to describe it, except for cold. Okay, I feel shitty just saying that. I loved Mom, but…""

""It's okay. Tell me.""

""Alright, so… My personal experience was that I could never do anything right in her mind. You know I was pretty good at school, right? She didn't care. I came to her one summer with all As and she just brushed me off. Whenever I tried to talk to her, she'd do this thing where she'd nod along and pretend to listen but actually didn't; that just made me feel stupid. But I don't wanna whine or anything. She had good days, too. Sometimes, she was really sweet. That'd just make me feel confused.""

My little brother heaved a sigh. ""She'd get really angry with me everytime I did something wrong. Something small was enough. I'd knock over a glass and spill water and she'd blow up at me, or I'd accidentally break a dish and she wouldn't talk to me for days. Like, she'd literally pretend I didn't exist. I felt… worthless. I know I shouldn't be complaining. She kept me fed and well-dressed and everything…""

""That's just keeping your base needs covered. You're still allowed to be unhappy with how she treated you,"" I replied. ""Dad kept me fed, too, and he fucking hated me. You wouldn't believe how much shit I did just to get a rise out of him. He was always angry with me, and it was like whenever we were alone, he would *actively* try to… I don't know, take me down a peg? Like, one time, he was driving me to the doctor's office because I'd caught this really bad cold—that was when I was around fifteen, I think. And the whole drive, he just kept on insulting me. He literally called me names. And I hadn't spoken the entire time, I was just trying to tune him out.""

""Fuck. Dad was really like that to you? I mean, I knew you didn't get along at all, but I always thought… hell, I don't even know what I thought."" He snorted. ""I can't believe those were the same two people we're talking about. Dad was always in my corner as a kid. He was there for me, he comforted me, he taught me a bunch of stuff… He just *saw* me, does that make sense? He was on *my* side.""

""I just wish there hadn't been sides,"" I said softly.

""Yeah. I think it was even worse for Jeremy. But then again, he was always really fucking weird. Honestly, I should have known he'd turn into something like this. There were a couple things I noticed, and, well… I never said anything. He told me not to, in fact, he basically threatened me once. For some reason, I actually only remembered that yesterday.""

""What kind of things did he do?"" I asked hesitantly.

Cas squirmed in his seat, hiding his face by bringing his coffee mug to his lips. ""You wouldn't wanna know. I shouldn't have brought it up. Maybe I'm remembering it wrong, too. Nevermind. So what's your plan for today?""

Deciding not to press the matter, I leaned back, sliding aside my by then empty plate. ""I'm gonna go talk to the Bannik. He's bound to be able to help me out.""

""Yeah, I reckon he'd know about this,"" Casimir said comfortably, his posture straightening as a smile returned to his face. ""Guess I'm gonna see what I can do in regards to new hires. And Dad, of course.""

""Appreciate it."" I stood up, reaching out to gather the dirty dishes in my arms, but my brother stopped me. 

""Leave it to me.""

I nodded, then went to pick up two bars of scented soap from my cupboard. A couple gifts never go wrong with the Bannik. 

The snow had been piling up outside overnight. Glistening white covered the rooftops of the house, the stables and the sauna. Thick fog hung languidly over the red meadow, making the trees behind it appear like phantoms rising from the mist. Ominous. Breathtakingly beautiful.

The spirit of the sauna answered my knocking and request for entry almost right away. He gratefully accepted my offering and listened intently as I stated my purpose. 

*""What you're asking of me is no simple task of divination,""* he gibbered. *""But I know what you’re looking for, and it can be done. Do come in.""*

Smiling gratefully, I stepped inside. The Bannik scurried over to the wooden bucket of water in the corner and proceeded to drag it into the middle of the room. I watched as he draped his arms around it. To my wonder, the water began to steam and bubble. The spirit dropped one of my soaps into the boiling bucket and then motioned for me to come closer. *""Your bloodline is a strong one, heiress. Your family has come a long way, and your past still echoes across this land. I can help you see memories that aren't yours, if you provide me with a drop of your blood. It will act as a key, or a conduit, if you will.""*

I nodded eagerly, pulling out my pocket knife and readily pricking the tip of my index finger. Ignoring the slight sting of pain, I squeezed out a bead of red and allowed it to drip into the bucket at the Bannik's instructions. The water seemed to boil even more furiously, turning a deep, dark red. I shrank back, the sight slightly unsettling. ""What now?"" I stammered uncertainly.

*""Now you dip your head in.""*

""What? I can't do that! It's gonna burn my face off!""

*""It won't. Trust me. Hold your breath and open your eyes once you're under. You will not be hurt.""*

I took in a deep, steadying breath before pressing my eyes shut and plunging face-first into the bucket. I really did feel no pain. The water bubbling around me was pleasantly warm, even. I could feel my hair being cautiously drawn up behind my head, and I smiled to myself when I realized that the Bannik was holding it up for me. Readying myself for whatever was about to happen, I opened my eyes. To my surprise, this, too, didn't hurt. I didn't even feel the need to breathe. For a moment, I couldn't see a thing. Then, all of a sudden, my mind was flooded with images.

Everything I saw and felt was different, wholly different. It took me a few seconds to realize that this wasn't actually happening. These were simply memories; an experience belonging to somebody else. I wasn't in the steaming room anymore, I wasn't in my woods at all; hell, I wasn't even in my own body. 

I was a man on a horse, riding at the front of a long trek. 

Walking behind me were roughly a dozen creatures of various shapes and sizes. Some stood upright while others prowled on all fours, some had faces while others had snouts; those aquatic brings who could not go on foot were being pulled along in a large basin on wheels or carried in jars. In front of me on the horse, nestled between my legs, sat a little boy. He was playing with the mane of my horse, braiding and twisting it while whistling a small tune to pass the time. Twigs and leaves were sticking out of his unruly, dark brown hair. Two short, fuzz-covered branches pierced his scalp on either side—nubs that would one day become large, majestic antlers. 

Once he got older, he'd surely be able to shift into a more defined human form instead of this (admittedly adorable) mixed-up body. I had yet to see him take on his primal, likely more monstrous appearance. It couldn't be that big and scary, considering his young age, but I had a feeling he was hiding it in order to appeal to my own human paternal instincts. I didn't want to embarrass the proud little thing by bringing it up, though. The child would grow into a powerful creature, but as he was now, he was abandoned, hurt and in need of protection.

Normally, a Leshy would be raised in the woods he was to rule upon maturing. The offspring of another Leshy and a swamp Kikimora, his purpose in life would have been to become the new woodland guardian once his father died. I had found the boy at a crossroads, all by his lonesome and in obvious distress. When I'd asked about his territory and kin, he'd just started crying and wailing like a dying animal. That had settled it for me; he was going to come with us. I figured he was like the majority of the others—a fugitive, chased out of his natural habitat by the believers, the self-proclaimed saints who intended to purify grounds that weren't theirs to claim by hunting down the spirits that reside upon them. 

I had never been a man of God, but I could understand their fear. Still, I didn't want the ancients to die. That's why I was doing what I did. Looking for a new home for these beings. I turned my head to look at the man riding alongside me. His steed was pale as death itself, his sallow fingers clutching the reins with steely resolve. Despite the bags under his eyes and the sweat and grease that made his black hair look like a bird's nest, he seemed to be holding up well enough. 

""Is it still following us?"" I asked, speaking in a language I, Fiona, did not know, but I, the rider, had been born into. 

""Yes,"" the man replied curtly, his voice deep and gruff. 

""Is it close?"" 

""I don't know.""

""Are you regretting this?""

A shrug. Egon Hettmann was a silent fellow. Still, the brief smile he threw me assured me that he hadn't lost faith in our mission just yet. 

""Um… Arek?"" a tiny voice piped up. The boy in my lap had turned to face me, his eyes wide. 

I didn't have to ask what he'd meant to turn my attention to. Something was covering the sky, the hills, the trees up ahead. I could not for the life of me find the words to describe it. The sight in itself was so foreign, so unnatural and alien that it stole the breath from my throat. The little boy started whimpering, and soon, his sobs turned into full-on weeping as he pressed his face to my chest. I placed my palm against the back of his head, somehow managing to stammer out gentle whispers of comfort that utterly failed in their effect seeing as I, too, was beyond terrified. 

""Is it alive? Is that the thing? Is it?"" the child whined, grabbing at my sleeves as if trying to pull them around himself. 

""Yes,"" I said softly.

""Why won't it leave us alone?"" he wailed.

""I don't know, little one,"" I replied.

""It's not moving,"" Egon remarked, sounding deeply unsettled but trying to hide it. ""Could we… go around it somehow?""

""I don't know that we can,"" I answered pensively. ""It's… it's gigantic."" It was hard not to lose face considering what we were looking at. Normally, with the creatures we'd already encountered, it had been easy to come off of the shock after a moment. They'd resemble humans or animals just enough for me to always keep my composure, to always stand tall and either talk to them or convince them to leave me and my party alone with brawn or the miller's black magic. Or, of course, to join us.

This thing, though, was completely unfamiliar, beyond description, beyond comprehension. It was impossible to tell if it had needs or wants or instincts, or what in the world they were, if it did. It was shapeless, shimmering in a strange mix of dusky hues. It wasn't even corporeal, it just seemed to stand in the sky like the sunset. Despite all this, it seemed to radiate a certain sentience, an intent that I couldn't fathom.

""Egon, you have to know something about this,"" I whispered.

He merely shook his head, eyes still trained on the thing. ""I swear I don't. I'd tell you if I did, but I got nothing."" He sounded almost astounded, and I don't know what disturbed me more—the fact that a worshipper of the Devil didn't know what nameless horror this thing was, or that he was visibly scared of it. 

""Arek!"" the tiny Leshy in my arms cried out. ""It's coming closer, I can feel it! It's coming!""

In the real world, I, Fiona, pulled my head out of the water with the gasp. The Bannik moved to my front, regarding me with probing eyes.

*""Did it work?""* he inquired. *""What did you see?""*

For a while, all I could do was stare at him. My throat had gone bone dry. ""I have no idea.""

I live in Auckland, New Zealand. Me and my girlfriend, live in uni accommodation in the city, I lost contact with my high school friends so practically my entire friend group lives in the same building. The uni dorms are very large, very full and (unsurprisingly) VERY loud. It's common to see and hear drunk students and party guests throughout the halls at night, you begin to tune it out over time and stop paying attention… perhaps that's why they were less careful around us.

Anyway, orientation week was coming up and my mates and I thought it would be a good night to go out clubbing. I don't know if it's the same everywhere else but all the nightclubs here treat orientation like it's Christmas. Toga parties, angel and devil nights, the whole lot. The rest of my group chat hardly ever even replies to messages like this but I can always count on Ethan and Andre to come out to town. So last Wednesday, we headed to Sapphire. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of Sapphire, it's always too crowded, and there's no seating whatsoever but Andre was set on going to this gig tonight so me and Ethan kind of just followed.

We got into the club with no problem as we had only a few pre-drinks. I thought I saw someone cut in front of us as the bouncer was checking our IDs. But they couldn't have. There was another bouncer on the other side who didn't seem to see anything so I didn't really react to it.

Andre went off to mosh while me and Ethan went to order drinks. Ethan orders a beer, I order a Jager bomb.  Just as the bartender hands me my drink, I hear Ethan's voice next to me.

""Is that dude staring at us?""

I paid no attention to Ethan, I didn't even look around, as I was too busy paying the bartender. I didn't really even take in his words because I was too busy wondering how a shot of Jager and Redbull could combine to cost $12.  But before I could reply, a full bottle of beer shattered around my feet. Ethan's beer. I flicked around to see what had happened, Ethan wasn't stupid, and he wasn't drunk. Had someone knocked it out of his hand?

But Ethan was gone.

At first, I assumed he had just headed into the moshpit to hang out with Andre. But then the bartender spoke up.

""Did you see that?"" She laughed, before looking around confused.

""See what?"" I replied, a bit bewildered by the whole situation.

She replied, ""I swear I just saw someone run into your mate?""

I looked behind me, looked at the ground. No Ethan to be seen. Looking at the floor, I think I remember a pair of legs sprinting past me but I was focused on looking for Ethan, so I didn't really register them or react to them.

Confused, I looked up at the bartender. She was gone as well? Where had she gone? There was another customer behind me in the line, and she was the only one behind the till so she wouldn't just leave her post like that.

I was beginning to get freaked out, I pushed my way to the moshpit to Andre, maybe Ethan was with him. Andre was in his own world, dancing in the mosh pit, he was focused on the DJ, focused on the girls, focused on dancing along with everyone else.

As far as I can tell, no one but me, even saw what was standing behind him. I can’t tell you what I saw for reasons i’ll explain later but trust me when I say this thing was NOT human, although… yet… human enough, that it could almost blend into a crowd like this… almost.

I was about to call out. To scream, or point. To call security to signal to Andre to run. Thank God I didn't, because as soon as that creature turned around to face me, everything clicked.

Ethan tried to point something out to me, and then he vanished.The bartender called out his attacker, and she vanished too.Yet Andre, and everyone around him, were minding there own business, and they were fine.

As it turned around to face me, its hideous features burned into the back of my eyelid. I calmly brought out my phone and began texting my girlfriend.

""I'm coming home. Do not text me, keep the doors locked until I arrive. I'll explain everything when I get there.""

&#x200B;

I turned around as calmly as I could and walked away. I walked up the stairs and turned up the road. I heard a side door open, I did not react.

I heard footsteps scuttling behind me, I did not turn around.

Then, Andre’s voice ""Yo Cody! Where are you going!?""

I prayed to whoever was listening that the creature was well hidden again, that Andre would not see it tailing me. I almost broke down, I wanted to scream at him to leave but I just couldn't. So I continued walking, then he said it.

""Who's that with you?""

As far as I could tell, those were his last words.

I walked to the halls, I wanted to cry but this thing was still sussing me out. I wanted to break down in tears but I knew what would happen if I registered this thing's existence. I started to wonder if leading this thing home was even the smart thing to do but I didn't CARE anymore, I just wanted to curl up in bed, and stay under the covers until whatever this thing was decided I was deaf or blind or stupid enough to leave alone.

I unlocked the gate, it clambered over the wall, I got in the elevator, IT GOT IN WITH ME. The whole ride it was towering over me, staring at me, wondering how I hadn't noticed it yet. I walked to my apartment and knocked on the door. My girlfriend called out to me.

The second she yelled out, the creature vanished, sprinting away at an unnatural speed down the hallway and ducking behind what I think was a bin. I don't know, I wasn't looking. I called out to my girlfriend, who impishly opened the door, clearly terrified by my text.

The thing was very well hidden yet the hallway had very little cover, whatever this thing was, it could conceal itself very well… not that it mattered because as my girlfriend opened the door, I saw it. The creature's face pressed up against the window behind her, watching ME. But it was different, the features were slightly screwed, slightly changed. The daunting realization hit me that no doors had opened in the hallway, and we were 6 stories up. This was not the same creature.

As my girlfriend turned around, the face at the window ducked out of sight.She turned back to me, it rose back up.

The face could switch from pressing its face against the window to vanishing beneath it with such seamless efficiency I had to remind myself I couldn't allow myself to be mesmerized by its movements. My girlfriend was being watched… but she would never have any idea. Had it been here all night? All week? How long had this thing been here, pressing its monstrous face against the window, and yet somehow staying out of sight?

&#x200B;

I quietly explained to her what had happened, starting by explaining that she couldn't react to what I said no matter what. Then explaining the creature's details, what it looked like. Maybe it was stupid but I had never been more stressed and confused in my life and I just wanted someone to talk to.

She calmly gulped, a tear rolled down her face. She wandered over to the cupboard and started sifting through papers. I wondered if she even believed me, or whether she was just taking my ""act natural advice"" very seriously. But then she pulled out the drawing.

A child's drawing… HER childhood drawing. A young girl, surrounded by at least half a dozen tall inhuman figures. I didn't get a good look, one second she was there in the hallway, the next I couldn't even recognize her corpse. A THIRD creature, stood in her place, her lifeless body broken and bloodied on the carpet. Her arms and legs were mangled and twisted like broken twigs, her face… unidentifiable.

If you were hoping to get a proper description of these things, I'm sorry. Now you know why that isn't going to happen. I would rather die than allow someone to recreate that drawing, God forbid someone ever posts a sketch of this thing on the internet.

&#x200B;

Terror doesn't even begin to describe what I was feeling, face to face finally with this thing. But it got worse when I heard the window shatter, and the door break down. All three creatures, standing in my dining room, staring down at me as I sat, staring at my girlfriend's mutilated corpse.

The creatures stood and waited.

And waited…

And waited…

Until finally I stood up, walked over to the fridge, took out a beer, sat right back down in my chair, and drank it calmly.

I don't know what kind of primal willpower I had in that moment, what kind of drive or mental strength I had during the worst minutes of my life. But after I did, the creatures left. In the blink of an eye, the body had been removed, and the blood was cleaned up.

A few days later I was called into the station to help clear the air about my missing friends, I told them very little. Ethan, Andre and my girlfriend have all gone down among ever growing list of missing people…

I wonder how many others are missing for the same reason?How many innocent people are in jail, blamed for these monsters' crimes?

I needed to make this post, I need to let people know.They no longer hide from me.

They are everywhere…

You couldn't possibly comprehend how many you walk passed every day, how many are watching you as you drive to work. You have no idea how many dark corners they lurk in, and how many windows they stand outside. You haven’t seen how many roofs they cling to, the crowds they stand among.

If you share this to your loved ones, make sure they read it lying down. Remind them to read it on a phone and tell them to hold the phone no less than 6 inches from their face. Because more often than not, you are not alone.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.8874093890190125}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.10821963101625443}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0043710065074265}]]","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9154781699180603}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.08051073551177979}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.004011043347418308}]]"
I was held hostage over Christmas. I’ve never smelled so much blood.,,87.0,0.0,,,"“So?” I asked, my voice shaking. “Is – is that good enough to let me live?”

The blonde woman looked at me like a was a science experiment. She cocked her head to one side and weighed my worth. I held my breath.

[The gun barrel aimed at my jaw. It shook.](

I wanted to believe that was a sign of hesitation, which meant hope.

I tried to swallow, but my throat was too dry. I was so wired that each of my own heartbeats shook me. 

I wondered what getting shot would feel like. 

Probably like a concentrated baseball bat strike. I would feel my teeth knocked out. If your last moments are bitingly painful, do you reach toward unconsciousness, even though it means never patching up what was said during your last fight with a loved one?

I focused on sitting still. For some reason, I believed that would help.

“Okay.” Her word shook me; I’d been expecting a bullet, and the stimulus nearly knocked me out. “But I’m keeping the gun aimed at your head the whole time.” 

I let out a breath that I didn’t know I’d been holding. “Okay,” I answered, my voice trembling. “But – well – why didn’t you just shoot Santa?”

Her shoulder fell. “You think I didn’t try?” She wiped a tear on her shirtsleeve. “He stood beyond the range that I could reach with my hands tied. The fucker knew exactly what he was doing.”

I nodded slowly. “Your arms are free now, though.”

“And I won’t hesitate to fire. I’m so sorry – I hope you know that.”

I began to stand up.

“But not sorry enough to spare you, if that’s what it comes to,” she answered.

We gazed at one another. I knew then that we each wanted to cry, but were both so far beyond shattered that we lacked the capacity for such an escape. 

I broke eye contact and leaned forward, pushing Jerry’s charred corpse off of my lap. Have you ever tasted French onion soup that was just too hot? The gooey surface stretches across everything it touches, burning any exposed skin with its scalding touch. Jerry was like that; his burnt skin parted from his body like a rich mixture of Swiss gruyere and mozzarella, clinging to my hands and thighs as it sloughed off. The slightest touch scalded my skin, adhering to it like rubber cement. The exposed flesh beneath was the smeared red paste of hot marinara, spattering across every available surface before what remained of his corpse pitched backward. The rest of his body smacked against the floor, dissolving into an amorphous blob now that his skin no longer enclosed the meat sack. 

He smelled like a pungent mixture of HoneyBaked Ham and the terrified excavation of bowels that had been liberated by fear and fire.

“This is your last chance.”

I snapped my attention upward and stared at the blonde woman with the gun. “What?”

“I’ve told you three times to cut yourself loose and stand. I won’t say it a fourth.”

“Sorry!” I stammered, reaching around in panic. “Sorry, I was lost in my thoughts and didn’t hear you – I – the knife is just under the seat, right? Should I use that? Of course. Hang on, let me reach for it – just give me a second, please – that’s okay, right? Okay, I’m doing it now, please don’t shoot – I’ve got it in my hand, now I’m cutting one string away – now here’s the other one-”

“I don’t need you to narrate your life,” she snapped. “Just finish and stand.”

“I’m sorry, I blabber when I get nervous, and the gun you’re pointing at my stomach makes me very-”

“Shut up. Stand.”

I pushed the cut ropes away and got shakily to my feet.

She nodded.

That was the moment that everything got real. When you’re trying to survive the next few seconds, your mind can shut everything else off. But the promises I made felt very different now that I had to pay them in full.

“Wait,” I stammered. My voice felt like a brittle leaf. “We still haven’t done it yet. It’s not to late.”

She looked at me with icy blue bombardier’s eyes and shook her head.

I knew then that there was no turning back.

My breath hitched once, but I had no capacity to cry. I realized that I never would again, that some part of me had forever been left behind in that chair. 

One step at a time, I stalked over to the man in the black suit, the man who had cut off his finger with garden shears. My shoes make a *squish squish* sound in the shallow pool of charcoal blood that Jerry had left on the floor.

I stared at the man, who was both blurry and shockingly clear all at once. He looked like a mannequin; his body was white and still. A stream of viscous blood dripped in a steady waterfall from his severed finger, and a wide pool of the liquid lay beneath his chair. My heart leapt at the idea that he might be dead already.

Then his glassy eyes rolled toward me. He tried to speak, but his voice was almost too raspy to hear. 

He smiled. “We survived. Thanks for coming to cut me loose, man.”

I wanted to cry. I wanted to break. But there was nothing in me whole enough to provide such a release. 

He saw it in my expression.

“No, man, just – hey, there’s no reason to hurt me, just walk away if you – wait – wait – wait, please wait-” He pressed his neck against his chest so that I couldn’t reach his throat. “Please, not now,” he whispered. “All of this made me realize why I want to live, I need to tell my sister I’m sorry – please, I just have to live long enough – wait, I-”

Nausea rose in my throat as I finally got the exacto knife into the side of his neck. He flinched, exposing, more neck, and I hit him again. I couldn’t help suppress the thought that *this is so easy*, that human skin offers so little resistance to knives that it’s a wonder we don’t kill each other more often.

It’s fucked up. But I couldn’t stop; I could only marvel at just *how* fucked up it all really is. 

Movies portray deaths, even gruesome ones, as somewhat glorious. But this was just messy. Once I couldn’t bear the thought of stabbing him anymore, I stepped back to watch his final minutes. 

There was no dignity. He convulsed, pissed his pants, and stared at me with deep frustration and soft confusion. I was grateful on his behalf when it ended.

I dropped the exacto knife onto the floor. Blood muffled the sound.

“And there you have it,” I said to the blonde woman behind me. I could feel her gun pointed at the back of my skull. “Now we both have unspeakable secrets to hold over one another.” I wiped my face, inadvertently smearing the man’s blood across my lips. “Is that enough to let me live?”

----------------

Now you see why the Valium’s not sufficient.

The bleach blocked a few hours of memory, but unfortunately, I still woke up. I’m going to mix it with ammonia in hopes that the mixture will be potent enough to erase awareness of what I am.

If it doesn’t work, I’ll finish telling about my experience.
