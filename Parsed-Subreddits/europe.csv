Ukraine donation thread!,,311.0,0.0,,,"Hello! As many postal services around Europe offer free shipping for aid packages for Ukraine, we would like to inform and encourage people to not let this opportunity go to waste. So please check with your national postal services if such a charity program exists in your country. If it does, we strongly encourage you to take advantage of it. If you do, please post a picture of the content of your package in this thread. It may inspire others and it is quite interesting in general.   

  
If your country offer no such program, the need for monetary donations should not be understated. It may not leave anything to post in this thread, but the most important aspect after all is the utility of the donation itself and not the form it takes. Any help is good.  

   
  What should I send? 

&#x200B;

*   **Food.** You should obviously not send fresh food that will expire quickly or go bad during the shipping process. 	Canned food, dry pasta, candy, tea and coffee are great examples of foods that can be shipped. You get the picture.  

&#x200B;

*   **Baby food** The same rules apply as for regular 	food, but for food intended to be consumed by infants.  

&#x200B;

*   **Food for pets.**  

&#x200B;

*   **Household products.** Things such as clean sleeping bags, pillows, bed-covers, vacuum flasks, garbage bags etc.  

&#x200B;

*   **Hygiene products.** Toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, wet-wipes and hygiene prodects for women. Basically things along those lines. This goes without saying but, do not send opened products. Only new. 

&#x200B;

*    **Medical products.** Bandages, bandaids, sterile compresses 	etc.

&#x200B;

*   **Electronics** Pwerbanks and walkie-talkies. Please check with your local postal service what the rules are for sending batteries in the mail!  

&#x200B;

As the rules for what can and can't be shipped may differ from country to country, please check with you local postal service before you send anything. This list is just a loose guideline for what kind of supplies are needed and in Ukraine. I used the Swedish postal service Postnord\* as a reference when writing the list, so again check what rules apply for you!   \*[","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9788644313812256}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.011704796925187111}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.009430783800780773}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.5700611472129822}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.4285215437412262}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0014173700474202633}]]"

### **Current rules extension:**
 
Extended [r/europe ruleset]( to curb hate speech and disinformation:
 

- No hatred against any group, including the populations of the combatants (Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians, Syrians, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, etc)

- **Calling for the killing of invading troops or leaders is allowed, but the mods have the discretion to remove egregious comments**, and the ones that disrespect the point made above. The limits of international law apply.

### Submission rules

These are rules for submissions to r/europe front-page.
	
- No status reports about the war unless they have major implications (e.g. ""City X still holding"" would not be allowed, ""Russia takes major city"" would be allowed. ""Major attack on Kherson repelled"" would also be allowed.)

- **All dot ru domains have been banned by Reddit as of 30 May**. They are hardspammed, so not even mods can approve comments and submissions linking to Russian site domains.

    - The Internet Archive and similar archive websites are also blacklisted here, by us or Reddit.

- We ask you or your organization to not spam our subreddit with petitions or promote their new non-profit organization. While we love that people are pouring all sorts of efforts on the civilian front, we're limited on checking these links to prevent scam.
