What was Littlefinger even trying to accomplish?,,70.0,0.0,,,"[SPOILERS FOR THE TV SERIES]

Late watcher here. I just finished season 7, and got to the very satisfying scene of Littlefinger's trial in Winterfell. All good. But seeing that scene made me question some of Littlefinger's real motives.

Some of the things he did made sense. By betraying Ned he killed two birds with one stone: avoided to pick the losing side, and killed the man who married the woman he always loved. Killing Jon Arryn and Lysa also makes a lot of sense: that allowed him to become Lord of Vale and Warden of the East. The murder of Joffrey was essential to secure an alliance with the Tyrells and snatch Sansa away from the Lannisters. All of this make sense.

But why sending a cutthroat after Bran and Cat, the woman he loved? Why framing the Lannisters for the murder of Jon Arryn, causing a gigantic, completely avoidable civil war? Why selling Sansa, another woman he loved, to THE GODDAMN BOLTONS, just to betray them in the blink of an eye? This three moves in particular don't make much sense to me. What was he trying to accomplish here?","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9766602516174316}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.014242978766560555}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0090968431904912}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8507494330406189}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.12771651148796082}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.021533990278840065}]]"
So what's the explanation for this? The White Walkers just like making swirly patterns with dismembered horse carcasses?,,1982.0,0.0,,,,"[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.7232224345207214}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.27204352617263794}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.004734015092253685}]]",
