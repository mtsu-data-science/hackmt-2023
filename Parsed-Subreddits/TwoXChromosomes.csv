Just RAN out of a lunch date,"The man ranted for like five minutes about how much he didn't want girl children and saw them as punishment. He said ""if my wife put out three girls in a row, I'd cheat til I got a boy"". 

(I explained that it was actually the man's material contribution to pregnancy that determines sex, but why did I bother? He was clearly dumb.) 

Oh he said ""I don't believe in gender roles but there's just so many things I don't think women are physiologically capable of."" in reference to me discussing painting houses with my dad. Painting houses y'all. 

He then went off about how our city was being ""taken over by alphabet people"". In response I played dumb and asked him what alphabet people were. He said ""Think about the alphabet. Who describes themselves with letters?"". I said, ""Like Sesame Street? The Muppets?"". He rolled his eyes and said I needed to get out in the world more (I'd just told him I moved back here after living various places and travelling for ten years. I mentioned I'd lived in five cities, been to 30 states and 15 countries.) he also said I should ""touch grass"". 

He opened a weed vape in front of me and went off to the bathroom to hit it. So I grabbed my coat and things and ran right out the door. Luckily we'd only communicated through the app we met on, so he has no way to contact me or my full name. 

He is 35. What a waste of an hour. 

But I will say I'm proud of myself. When I was younger I would just sit through the whole date in fear and play nice and pretend that I was having a great time so he wouldn't get mad at me. But I literally spent most of this one thinking ""how do I leave NOW?"" and took the first chance I got.

Edit: 

1. Met on an app. Had many text convos before planning this lunch. He was polite, smart, and interesting. His profile said ""liberal"". 

2. This was all kind of word vomited out pretty quickly. The first half hour or so was more casual chit chat, but once he got on this subject all the crazy came out. 

3. I didn't leave immediately because I didn't want him following me out! He pretty much had just said ""I hate women."" I wasn't going to run the risk he would prove it via violence. You don't even need a license for a gun in my state. I was being cautious.

4. Alphabet people is how some people do the wink and nudge to let you know they don't like LGBTQ+ people. The first time I heard it used was in a Dave Chappell bit. And the second time was today. I know he meant this because even though I played dumb, he then made his comment about this city turning into San Fransisco. I said ""The rent here isn't that high."" even though I know what he meant because of how associated my city is with gay culture. This is when he rolled his eyes, said he needed weed, and went to the bathroom. I made my graceful exit immediately after he was out of my eyeline.

Edit: 

Atlanta is pretty progressive generally, especially in this part of it. The app only lets you choose liberal, conservative, moderate, or other.

I might be wrong about sperm being what determines sex in babies. Biology was my only B in college. Killed my dream of a perfect gpa. Not my strongest subject.",19530.0,0.0,0.44502395391464233,0.008380480110645294,0.546595573425293,0.057038307189941406,0.002851244527846575,0.9401103854179382
"broke up with a guy ten years ago, his wife contacted me a week ago","We dated when I was in college. It was long distance the entire time. He was a soldier in Afghanistan when we met up again and 'started dating'. We'd know each other since grade school and reconnected. 


Once he came back home, I'd fly down to his base once a month to visit. After about a year and a half of that, I'd flown down and we'd gone to the lake for a day. There'd been one girl acting weird and later that night a message had popped up while he was in the shower. He had been saying he wanted to marry her. 



Cool, made that easy for him and I ended it and flew back home. That was the last time I ever spoke to him. 



Last week, I got a message on Facebook from his wife. She asked me if she could ask me something woman to woman. I said sure. 


She asked why we broke up ten years ago. He had told her I cheated. He had been the one cheating. 



She asked me about things he told her I had made him do. 




Things like checking his receipts from restaurants to make sure he wasn't drinking. Told her I would leave notes for waitresses when they didn't treat him right for being military. 


All this time, he'd been basically using me to gaslight her. Using me as this evil ex girlfriend to keep her in line, to keep her from questioning his behaviors too closely, because she didn't want to be like me did she? 



They have small kids and shes divorcing him because is doing the same things he did to me, cheating and lying. It's weird but I'd assumed he'd grown up and matured, been a good person to them. It made me sad he wasn't. 


I'm glad I was able to give her information that helped her feel like her choice was the best one , but I hated that someone like me, who hasn't really been intertwined in her life, had those answers.  


Not sure why I'm saying anything but I feel so strongly about being there for other women and even though this really isn't the type of support I thought we'd need to give, its still important.",16518.0,0.0,0.7351651787757874,0.008177288807928562,0.25665757060050964,0.9327109456062317,0.0653144121170044,0.0019747221376746893
AI accidentally proves gender inequality in job applications,"I just watched a TED talk about AI, and found something interesting. 

Amazon created a resume sorting algorithm and canceled it later. The problem was: AI was trained on resumes of current and former employees and learned to avoid women resumes. 

Direct quote of Janelle Shane from the video: 

«When they discovered that the algorithm had learned to discriminate against women, what happened is, they had trained it on example resumes of people who they had hired in the past, and from this example, the AI learned to avoid the resumes of people who had gone to women’s colleges, or who had the word «women» somewhere in the resume, as in «women soccer team» or «a society of women engineers». The AI didn’t know that it wasn’t supposed to copy this particular thing that it had seen humans do, and technically it did what they asked it to do»

Edit: there were several deleted comments about the term AI and how it was used “incorrectly” by stupid people who don’t understand anything, because AI doesn’t exist. 

So let me, a filthy peasant, specify something for elitists: yes, we know that “true sci-fi level AI” hasn’t been developed yet. Let’s not forget that the term AI nowadays is used loosely to also describe VI and ML. Despite this, the term AI is widely used by Big Tech and general public. That’s not point of this post anyway. The point is in the systemic approach of hiring policy.

Andrew Tate arrested in Romania on human trafficking charges,"[Andrew Tate]( has finally been arrested for human trafficking, he doxxed himself with a pizza box in a video response to Greta leading police to his location! What's even worse is that a FEMALE officer was also raided and arrested in connection to the previous human trafficking investigation, which tells me it was a cover up.
Some reports say he's only being held for 24 hours, while in others it's unclear. Are there any Romanians here to weigh in on the justice system over there? Of course I would love to see him pay for his crimes but at the very very least do you think he can be legally deplatformed if he used his accounts to lure victims? How many other countries can he pull this shit in if he's released and decides to move?",15048.0,0.0,0.4459869861602783,0.005863965023308992,0.548149049282074,0.1298346370458603,0.0037427132483571768,0.8664226531982422
Alleged Murderer Bryan Kohberger was not bullied by girls in school. Girls set boundaries he disrespected. More examples of media and people victim blaming.,"People need to stop calling it bullying when a certifiable creep is told off by girls or women.

It is NOT our responsibility to manage the emotions of someone we set a boundary with.

Boys/men are not entitled to making girls or women feel uncomfortable. 

When girls set a boundary, offensive or not, we need to stop calling it bullying. He was upsetting girls to the point they were telling him off.

They are the victims. Not him.

This is victim blaming. The same thing as saying women who dress provocatively are asking for it.

This narrative of how “incels” are born puts the responsibility of the “crimes” on victims.

Start teaching boys/men that their worth doesn’t come from their ability to get a girl or woman.

Girls and women, do not be polite. Our safety and lives depend on it.

This is re: news stories saying girls who previously attended school with BK “bullied” him, for example:
