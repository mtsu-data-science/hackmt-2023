"[MINI FAQ] Do I have to be a woman to participate here? What about the subreddit name? What about trans women? What are the rules, anyway?",,1738.0,0.0,,,"#Do I have to be a woman to participate in this community? 

##**No.** Any user who can follow the rules is welcome here. Women, men, nonbinary, agender, genderqueer, cis folks and trans folks, *everybody*. If you're not on board with that, you can fuck right off.

#But what about the subreddit name? 
 
##[Read this post]( from when 2XC was only a month old. We haven't changed our stance since then, and never will.

#What about trans women?  

##Trans women are women. TERFS can fuck right off. 

#What are the rules, anyway?  

##TL;DR: Keep it civil, keep it relevant. Don't start shit, won't be shit.  
##You can find the rules in the sidebar (community info for mobile users), or here's a direct link:  [2XC Rules](   

####Most moderator actions are the result of users breaking Rule 1: RESPECT. If you keep Wheaton's Law* in mind and participate in good faith, you'll probably never hear from the mod team.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

 ^*Wheaton's ^Law: ^Don't ^be ^a ^dick.

Update: I want to believe I can stay in my marriage…,,198.0,0.0,,,"Well, I didn’t. Last night I got him to cook dinner (we get hello fresh and it’s super easy) which I partially helped him with and then I went to bed. I wake up at 1am with my dog crying at the bedroom door and walk out to my husband playing video games. I asked if the dogs had been fed, he didn’t say a word and got up to feed them. I wake up this morning and come out to the kitchen and he’s left everything he used to cook with last night spread across the counters and the dirty plates out. I was immediately in a bad mood and started cleaning up and when he asked for the location of something of course I had an attitude, he got pissed and asked why and I just…blew up. I just started telling him I’m sick and fucking tired of the state of our house and having all this stress babying him even after HE gave ME trauma. I told him he was gonna lose me. He kept rolling his eyes, sighing, trying to interrupt me. I told him if he’s more worried about being right than being with me he will have to choose. He told me he’s pissed he is given an ultimatum and I was like ‘it’s almost like you’ve had a million chances to fix your fuckups before we got here.’ Then he started threatening to throw a bunch of moving boxes out and one of them was paint stuff we JUST bought together to paint the living room and he said ‘I don’t fucking care, did I seem interested in painting the living room? Do you think I was invested in that at all?’ I just laughed and took my rings off and walked away. I give up.","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.634469211101532}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.3630348742008209}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0024959715083241463}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.7883939146995544}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.18271787464618683}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.028888167813420296}]]"
Pressure to have sex after giving birth,,394.0,0.0,,,"So this is an issue that has been bothering me lately. Me and my friends are at this age where we are having babies, no1, 2 or 3 within the last couple of years. And i dont know if its just me but the idea of having sex even months after giving birth Seemed horrifying to me. I know that most of my female friends did have sex around 6 weeks after birth but for about half of them it was because their husband pressured them but they gave in even though they were scared as hell. I know that my mother had a very traumating birth but my father pressured her so much she just gave in and it was so painful for her. But otherwise he would have been angry and sad. What was your experience like? Im so glad im married to another women, so that that kind of pressure is off me, and i feel so sorry for all the women who have to go through this with their husbands.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.5987532734870911}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.39539211988449097}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0058546485379338264}]]","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9359848499298096}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.061126600950956345}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.002888577524572611}]]"
