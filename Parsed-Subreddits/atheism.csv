My younger brother got kicked out of Sunday School for saying Spider-Man is morally better than God.,"My brother is 13 years old, I wouldn't say he's an atheist, but seems to think God is morally questionable. He goes to church where they have Sunday school for younger kids and teenagers apart from the adult sermon. It's really our parents that make him go to church, he would stay home if he could. Same church I used to go to before I became an atheist, also I don't live at home anymore. 

From what I heard they were talking about why God lets bad things happen and my brother was challenging the Youth Pastor saying God is morally questionable for not stopping bad things when he has the power, then the Youth Pastor said something about ""Just because God has the power to stop it, it doesn't mean it's his responsibility to stop it"" Then my brother started quoting Spider-Man ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and then quoted the movie where Iron Man (RDJ) asked Peter Parker (Tom Holland) why he saves people and Peter said ""When you can do the things that I can, but you don't... and then the bad things happen... they happen because of you."" 

Apparently the back and forth debate escalated to the point where my brother said Spider-Man is morally better than God, and then the Youth Pastor had enough and kicked him out of the class, had him wait in the hall and went to get our parents to talk about his disruptive behavior and sent them home to cool down till next week. My parents were upset and grounded him for a week despite me arguing with them that they shouldn't punish questioning. They even questioned me if I was putting these ideas into his head, I really wasn't but my brother and I found the situation very assuming and we talked and laughed about it and I thought I would share.",17933.0,0.0,0.055327851325273514,0.0030389868188649416,0.9416331648826599,0.409442663192749,0.007186803501099348,0.5833705067634583
