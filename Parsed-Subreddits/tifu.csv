TIFU by pretending my boyfriends penis was a trumpet.,,5704.0,0.0,,,"This actually happened 4 or 5 years ago. 

I was living in a hotel while I was attending secondary school for the military and my boyfriend was visiting for the weekend. He had a mild case of tinea versicolor so he asked me to cover his chest and back with some Sulsun Blue. I happily agreed, he got naked and I got to rubbing. 

After he was fully coated in Selsun Blue, I got on my knees in front of him. Naturally he got excited BUT instead of things getting sexy, I tried to be funny because I’m painfully awkward. 

I grabbed his dick, looked up at him and said, “wouldn’t it be fun if I played your dick like a trumpet?” 
Like a good sport, he pretended to laugh at my attempt of a joke and I started my musical. 

I moved my face closer to his head and began making the trumpet noise while pushing the imaginary trumpet buttons on his shaft. 

This is where I really fucked up. I was having too much fun, got carried away and my mouth accidentally made contact. Next thing I know, I felt an air bubble traveling through his shaft and he let out the loudest screech I have ever heard. I couldn’t process what just happened as he fell onto the bed writhing in pain. He was left squirming and moaning (not good moaning) for about 10 minutes. I’m pretty sure there were a couple of tears that fell from his eyes. I felt HORRIBLE. I thought I ruined this man’s penis forever and if I didn’t, I thought he would never let me get close to it again. 

When the pain finally subsided, I told him how sorry I was and he forgave me. We laughed at the events that just transpired and agreed that I was never allowed to play with dick instruments ever again. 

He ended up marrying me a couple of years later, so maybe dick instruments aren’t really that bad. 


TLDR: while attempting to be sexy, I pretended my boyfriends penis was a trumpet and accidentally blew an air bubble into his dick causing him EXTREME pain.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9593192338943481}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.037344735115766525}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0033360144589096308}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9783546924591064}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.014440334402024746}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.007204955443739891}]]"
TIFU by having sex with my girlfriend while she had a tampon in,,1317.0,0.0,,,"This literally just happened and we can’t stop laughing about it, but it wasn’t so funny in the moment. 

I hadn’t seen my gf in a while and we went out for a fun night of cocktails with friends. Of course, Mother Nature is never on our side so it is her time of the month. No big deal. 

We go out and have fun, come home, and get ready for bed. I wake up in the middle of the night and her nipple is showing, so I do what any normal man does, I get aroused and decide it’s sexy time. 

She’s into it and we are having some fun exploring and having a bit of anal play. She decides she’s too lazy to get the lube, however, and just pushes me inside her. We have some hot sex, I finish, we crash in a pile of drunken ecstasy. 

Fast forward to the morning and she comes out of the bathroom “I can’t get the tampon out. I can’t even feel it.” Mind you, my girl is a brilliant medical doctor, and at this point panic is setting in because she’s having flashbacks of septic shock cases from med school from this sort of thing. She’s equally concerned about having to go to the ER to have it removed. 

I, having nothing to do with the medical field, do what all internet wizards do and look to Google for help. I then ask my Dr., now patient, not to fear, but to get me the lube and lay down on the bed. Begrudgingly, she does so. It’s me or a doctor friend and lots of embarrassment. 

I lube her up and go in (not as hot as it sounds) No dice. I can’t feel the string. I ask her to lift her legs like she’s giving birth. 

I get my fingers in up to the knuckle and feel the string. It slips my grasp at first, but I finally grab hold. Success!

For the rest of the day I’m to be addressed as doctor. 

TL;DR by having sex with my girlfriend while she was wearing a tampon. I ultimately retrieved it and am now a hero.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9737870693206787}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.022540001198649406}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0036728910636156797}]]","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.7799012660980225}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.21023163199424744}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.009867039509117603}]]"
TIFU by going above and beyond for a civilian drug screening and showing too much skin.,,238.0,0.0,,,"I’ve been in the Navy for the last 5 years and it is required that urinalysis tests are directly observed. My command had a problem with guys using a prosthetic called a whizzinator a while back and to combat this they implemented a local procedure that required guys to stand a couple feet from the urinal, drop their trousers and underwear below their knees and lift their shirts up above their belly buttons. It was totally invasive but after a few years you get used to it. Fast forward to yesterday and I had to provide a sample for a civilian contractor that works on the base I used to be stationed at. I filled out the paperwork and it said someone was going to follow me to the head (bathroom) so I figured it must be like the Navy since they work for the Navy. A guy followed me to the rest room and told me to go into the stall, I immediately went in there and adjusted my clothes like a toddler, the poor guy seemed taken aback and asked me if I usually pee this way. He informed me he only had to stand outside of the stall to take custody of the sample right away but he didn’t have to see it leave my body. I totally showed the guys my cheeks when I didn’t have to. 
TL;DR I followed my old Navy commands pee test protocol when i didn’t have to.
Does anyone have any experiences with observed drug tests?","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9470921158790588}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.049959179013967514}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.002948703244328499}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.5664187669754028}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.42173364758491516}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.011847571469843388}]]"
TIFU by asking my wife for a paternity test,,28671.0,0.0,,,"This didn't happen today, but a few weeks ago. My wife of 4 years gave birth to our first child last year. Both my wife and I are blue eyed and light skinned. Our baby has a darker skin tone. Over the past 6 months his eyes turned a very dark brown.

I had my doubts. My friends and family had questions. I read too many horror stories online.

I asked my wife half jokingly one day if she was sure the kiddo was mine. She starred daggers at me and said of course he is. I let it go for a while, but I still had a nagging doubt.

So right after thanksgiving I told her I wanted a paternity test to put my doubts to rest. She agreed.

A few weeks ago I came home to an empty house. Wife and son gone. On the bed she left the paternity results. And a petition for divorce.

Kid is 100% mine. Now I will only get to see him weekends and I lost the most amazing woman I have ever known.

TL;DR - I asked my wife for a paternity test. She decided she didnt want to be married to someone who didnt trust her.","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.7648549675941467}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.22592176496982574}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.00922329816967249}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9429442882537842}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.030299613252282143}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.026756051927804947}]]"
TIFU by sending my 10 year old to school with psilocybin mushroom chocolate in her backpack,,3418.0,0.0,,,"Context: I’m a pretty well respected business owner in my community. Involved in lots of groups, and have even run for public office. I also occasionally eat psilocybin mushrooms, mostly to keep depression and anxiety in check. 

Last week my 11 year old’s backpack strap broke as she was heading out the front door. I grabbed a travel backpack from my closet, hastily emptied it of its contents which were mostly just coins and receipts, and handed it to her. That afternoon when she came home she was holding a piece of chocolate wrapped in foil, and asked me what it was. *I immediately realized my fuckup.* About four months ago I took some homemade shroom chocolate on a camping trip and didn’t realize there were any left in the backpack. I had emptied it and put the rest in a safe place but had missed a couple. They must’ve been zipped up in a pocket. I asked if she’d eaten any, and she said, “No, I opened one and broke it in half and saw peanut pieces in it, so I didn’t eat it.” (Peanut allergies!) The “peanut pieces” were actually mushrooms! The piece she was holding was still wrapped so I asked what she’d done with the one she’d opened. She said she wrapped it back up and put it in the backpack. I searched the backpack but came up empty handed. I dug through it several times and couldn’t find the chocolate. I asked if she’d given it to someone or dropped it somewhere or thrown it away. She swore she’d put it back in the bag. I was freaking the fuck out- there was a piece of mushroom infused candy floating around the goddamn elementary school somewhere because of my fuckup. What if some kid ate it, saw Jesus, and ended up in the emergency room? They would certainly tell the parents what they’d eaten and where they’d received it, it would be traced to my daughter and then me, and I’d be asked to explain why the candy made the kid see dragons before being charged with child endangerment or assault along with drug possession. It would be on the news. The community Facebook page would be a bottomless mine of outrage. My business would be done. Not to mention the guilt of knowing I’d caused a traumatic experience for the child. Fuck me. Fuck. Fuck! I called my girlfriend and discussed how to handle it. We both agreed no kid was likely to consume the candy because it’s pretty nasty. Dark chocolate with no sugar in it, plus it’s filled with mushroom bits— even we have to choke it down. So hopefully if a kid found it and took a bite they’d spit it out. Certainly not much chance they’d consume the entire piece. But still— this is not good. I went back to my child and begged her to confess if she’d given it to a friend. (I told her it had fake sweetener in it and would make them sick.) She stuck to the story. I went back to the backpack, searched again, and still no luck. Finally I picked up a folder and shook it violently and the piece of chocolate flew out. I immediately put it in a locked drawer and will never let this happen again. 


TL;DR- left mushroom chocolate in a backpack, my child borrowed the backpack, found the chocolate, but came home with only 1 of 2 pieces. The missing piece was later found but not before I spent an hour imagining how my entire life was about to come crashing down.

Edit- A few things. 1- Guys I know it was a fuckup. That’s why I posted it in “Today I fucked up” not “life pro tips.” It was so bad I couldn’t tell my friends or a therapist so I unburdened myself on the internet. 2- Also, the number of people asking me where to get psilocybin chocolate is hilarious. No, there’s not an online store where you can order shroom candy, sadly. Maybe one day.

Edit 2- ok there are apparently places to buy shrooms but I don’t know where or how.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9542763233184814}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.0425916351377964}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0031320275738835335}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.953203558921814}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.04599044471979141}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.000806020456366241}]]"
