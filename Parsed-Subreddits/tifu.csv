TIFU when I made a Reddit post about my break up that became popular on TikTok,"For the record, I have no problem with this post getting downvoted or buried.

Yesterday one of my ex's friends contacted me. She said she got my number from my ex. Made sense. I blocked and deleted my ex's number since our recent break up, so if my ex wanted to continue communicating with me, she had to get creative. Hence, the friend. She said my ex wanted to meet for coffee and clear the air. The friend made it sound like my ex was really sorry for what she did to me. My head was telling me to save my energy and avoid meeting my ex at all costs, but my heart was telling me I used to love her at some point and maybe hearing her out would be the adult thing to do. I decided to ignore what my head was warning me not to do and agreed to meet with my ex. 

My ex and I saw each other this morning. It became very clear very quickly that she had no intention of apologizing for what she did during our break up. She wanted me to know that she found my Reddit post on TikTok. She showed it to me. It got a lot of attention. She reminded me how she had to find out from another person that I was planning to end our relationship and now she had to find out on TikTok that I shared our private life with strangers on the internet. I said well at least I didn't go down on a random girl moments before kissing someone I supposedly loved. My ex said she involved another person (the guy whose dick DNA was in my mouth) because I invloved another person (my friend that I spoke to about the break up before the break up). 

I got frustrated and said I guess that made us even. My ex disagreed. She said if she wanted to get even, she would have to post her side of the story on Reddit or TikTok. She was saying that to low key threaten me, but I didn't care, she didn't scare me, not until she said she might ""accidentally"" refer to me by my name and surname and username on social media. I said nothing would stop me from making the same ""mistake"" and dropping her real name too. She said ""challenge accepted"" and dared me to drag her name through the mud so she could do the same to me, but apparently worse. I called a time out and asked what the fuck she wanted. She insisted that I created another post. You're reading it right now. I was instructed to type the following words from her verbatim: 

""I kissed you after sucking someone else's dick to teach you what someone with balls actually tasted like because you obviously had no balls to tell me it was over between us. We're both to blame for the bad break up, but I blame you for most of our relationship problems because you were under the impression that being an introvert meant I was in charge of communication. I confessed to sucking another dude's dick when I was done making out with you... and guess what? I was still doing all the talking! I'm not perfect, but at least I told you what was going on instead of keeping my mouth shut."" 

""You can hate me all you want for using a random guy with a random dick to hurt you. However, you've been using me since the beginning of our relationship. I was good enough when you wanted to lose your virginity and enjoy all the perks of having a girlfriend, but as soon as you became more sexually experienced, you realized relationships actually required work. I'll admit, I'm a lot of work. But so were you. Dating a virgin guy with literally zero relationship experience meant I had to take the lead in and out of the bedroom, which wasn't always easy and enjoyable, but I did it because I believed you were worth it. I was wrong. You're just a little boy with a big appetite and a small stomach. Fun fact, you didn't make me cum as much as you think you did."" 

The end. There you have it. I'm the bad guy. I've done my part. I agreed to share this post if my ex agreed not to turn this into a name and shame game on Reddit or TikTok or whatever. I guess this is the price I had to pay for sharing my relationship drama in the first place. Fuck up number 1 for 2023. Fml.

TL:DR Told Reddit (anonymously) that my ex sucked another man's dick before she kissed me and broke up with me. My post somehow ended up on TikTok and got a lot of attention, including the attention of my ex, who then confronted me and made me create this follow up post to share her side of the story or else she was gonna reveal my real name on the internet.",30782.0,0.0,0.7271507978439331,0.028560074046254158,0.2442891001701355,0.638595700263977,0.008223576471209526,0.3531806766986847
TIFU by taking my wedding ring off at the gym,"TIFU up taking my wedding ring off at the gym.

Longtime lurker, first time poster and I am posting from my phone so please forgive formatting.

I have just recently arrived home following this FU.  I, a very happily married 36M with a small herd of children have been going to the gym in my little town since November 2022. I always go after getting the kids to bed which generally puts me there around 830pm.  

The gym I go to has two rooms. One has cardio equipment (ellipticals, treadmills, bikes etc) the other room has free weights and various other torture devices.  

My routine begins the same every time with 9.1-9.5 miles on the bike, which leaves me in a state similar to that of a walrus that has just managed to pull himself onto an iceberg, very wet and breathing heavy. This process takes me  to about 8:55 pm.  I enjoy hitting weights at this time because the gym is often (not always) empty and it leaves me to grunt and groan in peace. Tonight the gym was not empty when I entered the weight room.

Now I mentioned that I have been going to the gym since early November. In that time I have gotten used to the people that do spend time in the gym past 9 and this person was new. Not a big deal, she had brought her own yoga mat (the ones in the gym are blue and red and this one was tyedyeish) and she had her phone set up on a stand, I assumed she was making a video. Both of these observations were made as I walked down to my trusty bench to start my bent over rows.

I grabbed my dumbbells and sat down to continue my ritual and TIFU. I always remove my wedding ring before I lift and tuck it in my right sock for safe keeping. If I try to wear it, it digs into my hand and makes things most unpleasant. So I start grunting out reps with ol’ righty and just nicely switched to lefty when I feel a tap on my shoulder. So I stopped what I was doing and turned to see new girl standing behindish me sporting a menacing glare and wielding her iPhone. I popped out my ear bud and asked what was up. The following conversation is as I remember it.

Me: Hey, what’s up?

New Girl: You’re disgusting.

Me: Excuse me?

NG: You saw me in here and took off your ring, planning on chatting me up? (This is a little paraphrased, she swore a little too and I wasn’t taking perfect notes)

Me: What?

NG: You’re gross.

Me: Ok.

I proceeded to put my earbuds back in and get to work while she stormed to the other side of the gym and started packing up her stuff. I watched her head for the exit while I was resting between sets. Anyway, I’m rowing away and out of no where I’m blasted with a cascade of liquid which leads me to drop my dumbbell and spin around to see what’s going on.  There’s new girl with her recently emptied pink yeti screaming at me ( I’m assuming for being gross, it was unclear as I had my buds in still.) I remove my ear buds so I can understand her and she storms away. I think the highlight of the exchange is that my gym shirt now smells like vodka. Do most people drink at the gym? Am I doing this wrong?

I’m home, showered and explained why my shirt smells like I’ve had a raging party to my wife. We’ve both had a good laugh. If I see new girls video on social media I’ll be sure to share it here. I don’t know who she was but it’s a pretty small town so it might pop up. Cheers.

TL;DR I took off my wedding ring at the gym causing a lady I’ve never met before to go bananas.

EDIT: Well this got a lot of attention!  So I had emailed the gym owner last night at the request of my wife. (She feels the same as many of you that this lady could be dangerous to others).  He has already emailed back. Apparently new girl received a ban early 2022 for aggressive behaviour with another gym patron. Owner is going to call me later today for some follow up. 

I will definitely look into the silicone rings, thanks everybody!

EDIT: Final Update. I had initially planned on responding to a bunch of the comments but there are just so many…

Anyway, new girls previous aggression was verbal. The gym owner has deactivated her key fob and placed her on perma ban. He has also called a few of the smaller gyms in the area to give them a heads up (super cool dude).

Thanks everybody for the thoughts and advice. I know I’ve let a bunch of you down by not pressing charges etc. But I also know I have made many of you proud by completing my cardio after lifting tonight. Before I left for the gym tonight my wife recommended a rain coat for protection (she’s the best).

That’s all for now unless the video surfaces.  Cheers.",30138.0,0.0,0.1471582055091858,0.005094317253679037,0.8477475047111511,0.5382141470909119,0.00818332377821207,0.45360255241394043
TIFU by Telling My Friends How I Keep Myself From Cumming,"Of course this wasn’t actually today but was in fact a few weeks ago. My roommates and I were sitting on the couch after taking some rips and were just chatting. I, being absolutely zooted, turned to my roommate and asked him what he thinks about to keep himself from nutting when he and his girlfriend do the deed. And to which he gave a quite reasonable answer of, “I just stare at a wall and let my mind go blank.” 

Where this takes a horrible turn is when he asked me the same thing. At which point I turned to him and confessed that I think about Tarzan. Specifically the part of the movie when Tarzan is sliding down the vines and the song “Son of Man” is playing in the background. I can’t say for certain why this image always pops up in my head, but it has never failed me so far.

Cue the eruption of laughter as all of my roommates are baffled by my method. Everyone immediately started looking up the video on YouTube and showing me the clip of Tarzan sliding down the vines, which made me very flaccid indeed.

In the weeks after, every time I bring my girlfriend to our house and go upstairs, my phone is bombarded with messages from my roommates sending me gifs of Tarzan sliding down the vines. I’m worried that this will not end anytime soon, as I haven’t been able to get it up ever since.

TLDR : I told my roommates that I think about Tarzan to keep myself from nutting too early.",29358.0,0.0,0.9251978397369385,0.013802929781377316,0.06099923327565193,0.9267129302024841,0.013546095229685307,0.0597410649061203
TIFU by showing my friend their doppelganger.,"I was on the tube on the way to see some friends in North London. Whilst looking around on the tube to pass the time, I noticed someone a few seats down that looked remarkably similar to an old friend of mine who I hadn't spoken to or seen for a while, although this person was a lot rougher round the edges and about 20kg heavier than my friend is.

As the resemblance was uncanny, I decided to sneak a quick photo of the person to send to my friend. When I got out of the tube and regained service on my phone, I sent them a message with the photo with the caption ""this guy looks just like you if you packed on some pounds'.

The message was opened almost immediately...

No reply for a few minutes...

""That is me OP...""

I haven't been able to respond yet, I'm too embarrassed. I feel truly awful about it though. Serves me right for being a bit of a twat.

TL;DR took a photo of someone on the train I thought looked like a fat version of a friend I hadn't seen in a while, sent it to my friend and it turned out to be them.",27374.0,0.0,0.7135189771652222,0.00965671893209219,0.2768242359161377,0.756764829158783,0.24173803627490997,0.001497225253842771
TIFU when I (19m) missed all the signs that my roommate (22f) was interested in me,"[Update.](

My roommate moved out this morning. She's immigrating. The two of us have shared an apartment for almost 2 years. I've always been attracted to her, but I didn't want to be that guy who tried to fuck the first female roommate he got, so I did my best to keep our relationship as platonic as possible. However, last night being the last night my roommate and I were gonna be roommates, I decided to tell her that I always thought she was attractive. I also made it clear that I didn't expect anything to happen, I just wanted to get it off my chest so we could laugh about it without worrying that it might be awkward the next day, and the day after that, etc. My roommate playfully punched me on my shoulder and said she gave me so many opportunities. I had no idea what she was talking about, which prompted her to provide the following examples: 

1. When we were dancing in the club and the song finished, our faces were so close together, our foreheads were literally touching. But instead of kissing her at that moment, I apparently rolled my eyes to the back of my head and asked if I looked like Storm in X-Men.
2. When she asked me to show her what kind of porn I enjoyed watching, I showed her mine and she volunteered to show me hers. We were sitting on the couch, watching people fuck, and still I did nothing. 
3. When I was hospitalized, she said she would be happy to nurse me when I get home, but only if I promised to wear nothing but my hospital gown. 
4. When she asked me for a piggyback ride to her room when she was done showering and only wearing a towel.
5. When she confessed to sleeping in one of my shirts because I was away for the weekend and she wanted to feel close to me.

I can go on, it was a long list, but this was the top 5 for me. It seemed so obvious now, but at the time I was fucking clueless. I think I was too focused on NOT crossing that line that my brain completely blocked out any signs of sexual chemistry. My roommate and I laughed about it, but deep down I was so angry at myself for losing out on what could have been a more exciting experience because I was unable to connect the dots.

Tl:dr I was blind to the signs that my roommate was attracted to me, and now that I finally know what I've been missing out on, it's too late to do anything about it because my roommate is moving overseas.",22813.0,0.0,0.06770609319210052,0.003161872737109661,0.9291320443153381,0.9546160101890564,0.03693501651287079,0.00844899658113718
