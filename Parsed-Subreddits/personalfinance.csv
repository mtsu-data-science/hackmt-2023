"Wells Fargo ""High Yield Savings Account""",,137.0,0.0,,,"We have a ""HYSA"" with WF which is earning .02%.  Not 2%, not .2%, it's actually .02%!  I've been needing to do something about this for a while, shame on me for keeping cash in an account which doesn't bring a return but we've become reliant on WF for many of our banking needs and I just didn't give it the proper attention needed.

So, when I called WF to see if I could get a better deal through Private Banking they were quite evasive.  They told me they ""don't quote rates over the phone"" and I needed to come visit them in person to discuss.  When I finally convinced the person to give me a straight answer (they admitted their interest rates are ridiculously low and they are not competitive) I felt like I've been misled.  The account is literally named a ""High Yield Savings Account"", feels like false advertising to me and I've been getting screwed by WF for years.

Anyway I'm looking at moving my savings to a I-Bond or an online bank with at least 3.5% interest rate, any suggestions?  Thanks in advance :)

*Edit - thank you all for your comments and suggestions.  I’ve narrowed the list to Ally, Discover, Capital One, Citibank and a local credit union.

As for why I’ve stayed with WF all these years; I have a good working relationship with a WF mortgage broker, he is proficient and provides great rates and service.  Aside from the issue with the low interest rate I’ve been satisfied with WF and have had no issues.  I’m also loyal to a fault, I value long term business relationships and I prefer not to jump around.  However, sometimes it’s necessary so I’m jumping.","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9762139916419983}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.01945200189948082}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.004334039054811001}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9663751721382141}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.030297910794615746}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0033269000705331564}]]"
Car Was Borrowed By Family Member Without My Permission And Is Now Totaled. What Do I Do?,,644.0,0.0,,,"Hey Reddit,   


So I was over at a family members house the other night. Ended up spending the night and left my keys on the counter. Another family member borrowed my truck in the middle of the night, it turns out that someone hit them at like 2am when they were going to the gas station and totaled the vehicle. I never told them they could borrow my car and the worst part is they have an expired liscense....   


Beyond that, I also don't have comprehensive since it's an old vehicle. I do however pay for uninsured/underinsured motorist of $25,000/$50,000. So am I completely screwed in getting anything from insurance? I haven't contacted them yet. It happened last night and I'm still trying to figure out how the hell to even handle something like this.   


I do have the incident report through the local police and requested information about it. But it's saying it will likely be a few days before I can get any of that. The other driver didn't have any insurance. They were apparently driving without their lights on which is what caused the accident. But that's all just what the POS who stole my truck said. I don't have anything concrete to go off of right now and it's incredibly frustrating.   


If the person driving had my permission to borrow the vehicle would I be covered then? As I mentioned, they have an expired license. I'm just reeling about what to do as this is my only vehicle and is going to make my life a living hell because I don't have the cash saved up to replace it right now.   


Beyond that, how is the towing/impounding handled? Surely I'm not responsible for any of that because I had nothing to do with this? Just any advice you can give would be greatly helpful because I have no idea what to do right now. The driver has vowed to pay me back and replace the vehicle as he is supposed to be getting some big check in the next few weeks. But beyond hoping that actually comes true what can I do?    


If you guys need any more information let me know, I'll keep an eye out and try to respond.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.8355405330657959}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.16081418097019196}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.003645283868536353}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.6772881150245667}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.3090011477470398}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.013710801489651203}]]"
