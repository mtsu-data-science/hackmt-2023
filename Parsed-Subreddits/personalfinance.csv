A new 30% federal tax credit on insulation means now is a great time to reduce your heating/cooling bill,"Specifically, the basement/crawlspace and attic are very cost-effective places to insulate. This is especially true for houses older than a couple decades. I have no personal stake in the insulation business and say all this as someone who learned from working on my own home. Here are some tips:

* Basement/crawlspace: are the walls just bare concrete? Is there any insulation between the joists under the house's floor? If no to both--or if there is insulation under the floor but it's sagging or damp--the insulation is inadequate and you're losing tons of energy (and money) through the foundation walls.
   * These days, [most people advise insulating the inside of the foundation walls]( and not under the first floor (though if you already have insulation under the floor and it's in good shape, you can keep it). Insulating the walls also helps keep any pipes in your crawlspace from freezing, and will prevent additional heat loss if you have any ducts/furnace/AC/water heater down there.
   * I'm a fan of [EPS foam board]( because it's cheap, works well, easy to DIY, and causes less pollution than other types of foam. Colder climates will probably want 2 layers of foam board (R-15); warmer climates might be ok with 1. In my case, I calculated a payoff time of around 2-5 years for adding these; it would be even faster if I kept my house at more typical heating/cooling temperatures.
   * If you have a crawlspace, you may want to seal the crawlspace floor with a vapor barrier (""encapsulation""). If you have a moisture problem down there, you should definitely do that. Now is a good time to run a cheap test for [radon in your house]( to protect you and your family from lung cancer; if you have radon, encapsulating the crawlspace will be a big part of the treatment.
* Attic: [if you have an attic, blowing in insulation is cheap and you can rent a machine to DIY it if you want. ]( a look up there and use [this site]( to determine if you have enough, and how much you should add.
* Walls: unlike attics and crawlspaces, walls are harder and more expensive to insulate. However, if you're doing a remodel project that involves removing wall sheathing already, you should definitely assess whether you wall insulation is adequate, and improve it if needed. [This site]( has some notes on wall insulation at the bottom.
* Sealing leaks: this is potentially the most cost-effective item on the list. Search for leaks in the crawlspace and attic (easiest before insulation is added). Leaks in the house matter too, but leaks at the top and bottom of the house matter most. There's a good chance you'll find holes big enough for a cat to crawl through, and those should be blocked with wood or foam board. Smaller leaks can be sealed with spray foam or caulk.
* Energy assessment: you can hire an expert to come out, assess how leaky your house is and whether the insulation is adequate, and recommend fixes. Your state or utility may offer incentives for this, and it also benefits from the federal tax credit.

Wife's best friend passed away and left my wife her house,"My wife's best friend of 45 years recently passed away. Due to some internal issues with her friend's family, she changed her will and left her house to my wife. We have no idea the status of the mortgage on the house or if there is even a mortgage. I really have no idea how this is going to play out with my wife getting the house. Can anyone shed some light on how this all works? I know this is really an opened ended question but I really have no idea how this is going to work.

Thanks

&#x200B;

Update: Thanks everyone for the advice.   


Little more information about the situation. We live in the northeast of the US; wife's best friend was in Texas. She was never married and never had children. We're really in the dark about the details of the will and executor. It was just never something my wife talked with her about because honestly, she never assumed she was getting anything of value, perhaps just some personal affects but that's about it. Her friend asked her 3-4 months ago if she would want the house, my wife said that was fine if that's what she wanted to do. About a month ago her friend confirmed she updated her will and named my wife as the recipient of the house.   


Long story short, there's a sister-in-law involved in this that has been literally waiting for her to die to get her hands on her house and money. The will was updated to direct anything of value away from this woman.",4226.0,0.0,0.39637067914009094,0.013686507008969784,0.5899428725242615,0.6000893115997314,0.024391792714595795,0.37551888823509216
"My facebook was hacked. They ""locked my account"". 1 month later I got a paypal bill for $2600 of fb ads and paypal denied my dispute. What can I do?","

My facebook was hacked and someone else accessed it, I went through the process to lock my account but it turns out damage had already been done and the hacker had run $2600 in facebook ads that I didn't know about until I got an invoice from paypal. The business name on the ad campaign is some address in California far from me. Paypal denied my dispute and now I'm feeling like I'm on the hook for the money.

I'm trying to contact Meta to see what they can do, and potentially file a police report. What else can I do? Thank you",4074.0,0.0,0.01911940798163414,0.0030986322090029716,0.9777818918228149,0.033626068383455276,0.002821350935846567,0.9635525941848755
"Teller shorted me when I cashed a few checks, what should I do?","I went to the bank and cashed 5 checks totalling $1,000. There was a check that was worth $250 that he said there was a problem.  He tried cashing, but didn't go through, and did it again.

The teller gave me $$ in an envelope, but i didn't count before leaving. When i got home, i noticed it was short. I called the bank, and went to see the manager next morning. I kept everything as is and showed the manager. 

He checked the cameras, and confirmed that the teller is short. He noticed that the teller cashed it AFTER i left the bank. He said he will have his senior manager call me.

It has been 1 month and still nothing. 

What should i do?


*update: I went to talk to management, and he said that it hasn't been a month. Why? Well, the incident was noted on December 17th, but because of the holidays and weekends, it has only been 10 business days. He said to give him 2 weeks, so that's 14 business days.

He said that my case is in the pipeline, and I'll get an update next Tuesday bc Monday is MLK. I agreed and said I'll contact the police for theft next week and file a complaint if it doesn't get resolved.",3802.0,0.0,0.8651197552680969,0.007577509619295597,0.12730267643928528,0.6895134449005127,0.009098565205931664,0.3013879954814911
"Am 55, inherited a home without a mortgage, the only home I own. Not sure if I should live in it or sell it.","Throwaway account because I am *not* financially savvy and am, honestly, pretty ashamed about that. So here's the situation:

I am 55, lost my life savings to medical debt in my 40s. Have always worked, love my trade, but around the time when I was rebuilding, the pandemic hit. I put my career on hold to care for my mother who became critically ill. I don't regret that decision one bit, she was a helluva woman that sacrificed for everyone her entire life, but caregiving wipes you out in every way possible, mentally, financially, emotionally. She died last summer and left me the house (a 50 year old ranch house, 4 bedroom, appraised $440k) and $295k in a savings account.

Here is the dilemma:

I can stay in the house (needs about 4k on the plumbing work and eventually a roof which has been replaced once. Some renovations, kitchen and the bathrooms, would add another 10k). The house itself is old but great, new appliances, water heater, ac, etc. It's in a quiet, friendly and established neighborhood, close to everything. I have no debt, my truck is paid off so my expenses are now $1700 a month. It's insane, I have never had such low expenses, even as a kid.

But a lot of my friends tell me it would make more sense for me to move out into a smaller place and sell it before the Phoenix market crashes or the house otherwise starts sinking in value. Buddy last night said it always makes sense to take cash. ""No brainer"".

Rent is atrocious in Phoenix so I could buy somewhere smaller and, I assume make a profit but I will just turn around and have to buy again. I don't know if it's worth the trouble, even in this old house. (Oh, I forgot to mention the furniture in the house is worth around 15k which I also inherited). And I wouldn't mind having a roommate, if anything just for the company, but a bit of money from the rent would be nice, of course.

Listen, I don't have a lot, I am okay with that. I feel rich in life in other ways, I love my life, even now. I just want to make the most of what I have and, as I said, I am really overwhelmed.  Sell, stay? Really appreciate any guidance you can give me, thank you.

Edit - Thank you, guys, so much! Just two things I have to say because I am having some trouble responding to everyone. First apologies for sounding like a jerk on the ""cash poor, I only have $295k"". That's a lesson in humility so thanks for setting me straight on that. For someone who lost much more in my life savings, you would think I would know better.

And then, not to get too weepy or deep here, but your responses really have blown me away. You are a great group and I want to encourage anyone who needs to hear this to live from your own personal values and not worry what others think. I am staying in this great house, can't wait to get back to work, have a BBQ and introduce myself to that cute neighbor two doors down. Feels right for me. Appreciate y'all!
