/r/Games Is Looking For Moderators!,,39.0,0.0,,,"Hello /r/Games! As the subreddit encroaches on **3.2 Million subscribers!** we once again find ourselves struggling to keep up with the manpower required to moderate a growing subreddit that is already of a considerable size. Generally, as a mod team we run on the smaller side. This has many benefits including easier communication and easier consensus. Unfortunately the downside to this is when real-life comes calling, our team can be very quickly put on the back foot in terms of handling moderation duties. Many people come to /r/Games as their primary aggregate of news in the industry, so keeping it clean and well managed is our chief concern.

In an effort to keep individual manhours to a minimum (this is a volunteer gig after all), while still maintaining our commitment to strong moderation, we simply must replenish and even expand our team. With that in mind, we are opening recruitment.

**We are currently looking for Moderators of all time-zones. We have a particular interest in people who can cover Australian/Asian timezones, although again, we are seeking mods from all timezones** 

No matter the country you live in or the hours you're active, if you feel like you would be a good addition to our mod team then please read on and, if all sounds good, submit an application!

Below, we've included a list of Requirements and Preferred Qualities we're looking for in our applicants.

----

# A content warning of sorts:

While modding /r/Games, we deal with a large volume of heinous content including but not limited to transphobia, homophobia, racism, poor taste remarks about rape, suicide, etc. Moderating this subreddit will expose you to potentially triggering content on a daily basis.

If seeing, or often times having this directed towards you is going to be an issue, modding r/Games may not be a good fit for you. Please consider this carefully before applying.

In a similar but less important vein, while it is not impossible, avoiding spoilers can sometimes be rather difficult for large/upcoming games.

# Requirements

- Power Mods/Mods of many other large subreddits need not apply. Most of our moderators only moderate /r/Games, or one or two other smaller sized subreddits. We have no interest in sub collectors. Experienced moderators are great, but we don't want to be just another notch on your belt. Every year we put this in, and every year Power Mods apply anyways. Please do not waste our time or yours.

- You must be able to coordinate with the rest of the moderation team while you are moderating. We currently use [Discord]( for team discussions and communicating when you will be away for extended periods of time.

- Your current reddit account must be at least one year old.

- You must be willing and able to put a decent amount of time into moderating on /r/Games. If you can only spare an hour or two a week then please do not apply.

- We expect applicants to be familiar with the /r/Games community, but we do not require moderators to be actively posting.

- Moderating is greatly helped by third-party browser extensions such as Reddit Enhancement Suite. Being able to install such extensions on the computer(s) you use to browse reddit would be a very good thing. **Mobile apps lack tools required for quality moderating. Because of this, individuals who primarily browse Reddit via mobile should not apply**

# Timezones

- We are currently seeking moderators from **all time-zones.**

----

# Duties

Moderators of /r/Games are expected to be able to perform most reddit moderating tasks - we do not have dedicated specialist roles on this subreddit. 

The main thing that takes up our time is reviewing user reports on posts. This community is active and passionate but unfortunately some users go too far with shitposting or making attacks on other users. Moderators are also expected to be able to answer messages that we receive from users via the subreddit's moderator mail, such as queries about post removals or people checking if a proposed post would fit the rules of the subreddit. 

Other issues you will encounter as a moderator include dealing with spam and deliberate self-promotion, banning users who have seriously broken the subreddit rules, and discussions with other moderators for reviewing moderation actions or planning the future of this subreddit.

----

# Questionnaire

We have decided to shift our recruitment process away from a 2-round system and move to just one round which will mostly constitute what Round 2 used to contain. Round 1 was originally meant as a filter for low-effort applications, however as the years have gone by and our questions have evolved, Round 1 has become somewhat redundant.

**All of this is a long winded way of saying that you should put effort into your answers. Low-effort responses will be discarded.**

Please send your applications through via [this form]( and please be sure to modmail us on the Reddit account you applied with informing us that you applied simply so we can be sure it isn't an imposter trying to slander your good name.

----

We will gather applications until **Friday, February 10th**, and then review them. From there we will go over applicants as a team, and hopefully add some new mods! The process may take several weeks; we'll be as quick as we can but we imagine there will be lots of internal discussion and we cannot guarantee that there will not be delays.

We are looking for moderators that can provide long term commitment to /r/Games (at least 6 months), members of our community who want to help us keep our goals and provide the content our users love. 

We have very modest activity requirements from our Moderators to make sure there isn't anybody just sitting on the list. This is based on **all** moderator actions, and not just removals. We don't want to waste our time or yours, so If you don't feel you can commit to helping our community, please hold back your application until a time when you feel you can.

**Please modmail us after you have applied so we can confirm it is you!!**","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8457205891609192}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.15285351872444153}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.001425888272933662}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.6983019113540649}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.2820436358451843}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.019654439762234688}]]"

EA/Motive are aware of and investigating the graphical issues with Dead Space on PS5.,,138.0,0.0,,,"**Update:** [Patch incoming, no ETA yet]( (Thanks /u/xxTheGoDxx)

Per the [official launch thread]( over in /r/DeadSpace, from [their community rep.](

[John Linneman (Digital Foundry) also has shed a bit of light on the problem](

> [[pic]]( For those curious, this is what VRS does to the image quality on PS5. The actual resolution is much higher (look at Isaac) but VRS causes shadowed regions to basically lose most of their detail.

> [[pic]]( This is a brightened example of what happens on PC even. 4K native with TAA produces much sharper than DLSS or FSR2 even quality modes. The lower your internal res, the worse this gets. It murders texture quality.

It sounds like the culprit may be VRS ([Edit: Variable Rate Shading]( and not necessarily limited to the PS5 though my understanding is its much more apparent on that platform. 

Per EA rep in the launch thread above, this is one of their most important ""non-game breaking"" bug focuses and they are working over the weekend to identify and fix it.

There are a few other issues peppered in the game, some more or less severe depending on the platform but you can submit bug reports [here](","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9395721554756165}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.04262226074934006}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.01780562847852707}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9725170135498047}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.020489923655986786}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.006993135903030634}]]"

Critic Reviews
-------------
    

**[AltChar]( - [Semir Omerovic]( - [100 / 100](

>Hi-Fi Rush has pretty much everything that makes a video game fun and even more importantly it's not trying to be overly precise and challenging like many other rhythm-based games. It's a complete package that hits the right notes over and over again, proving that big publishers should just let developers create games they really want to create.

-------------

**[Attack of the Fanboy]( - [Noah Nelson]( - [Unscored](

>Hi-Fi Rush is a bundle of joy so far. I can’t stop tapping my foot while playing it, I genuinely laugh out loud at the jokes, and I’m interested to see where the gameplay and story go next. While you wait for our full review to come out, know that we recommend playing Hi-Fi Rush, especially since it is free to Game Pass subscribers.

-------------

**[Kakuchopurei]( - [Jonathan Leo]( - [80 / 100](

>Hi-Fi Rush is clearly one of 2023's most pleasant gaming surprises, as well as a respectful nod to the glorious 2000-era of action titles where you just want to have pure unadulterated fun with simple mechanics to comprehend.

-------------

**[Life is Xbox]( - [Dae Jim]( - [Unscored](

>It came out of nowhere but this is an incredible high quality game with memorable characters, unique rhythm gameplay, nice visuals and a fantastic soundtrack.

-------------

**[Polygon]( - [Diego Nicolás Argüello]( - [Unscored](

>The shadow drop was novel in and of itself, but the game is a triumph. The gorgeous animations and Jet Set Radio-esque art style are vivid and arresting. The array of tutorials, visual aids, and clever mechanics makes the rhythm aspects approachable to genre newcomers. And the vibrant, positive energy is present in every beat, keeping you tapping your feet as you take down a corporation built on a lack of vision. Hi-Fi Rush is a cathartic anthem that arrived at the perfect time.

-------------

**[VGC]( - [Jordan Middler]( - [4 / 5 ](

>Hi-Fi Rush is oozing with style and confidence, but like a messy first album, there are some deep cut tracks that don’t hit as hard as the opening few hits. What can’t be denied, however, is how excited we are for the sophomore effort, and the seemingly limitless versatility that Tango Gameworks have shown off in this bold, out-of-nowhere joy.

-------------

**[WayTooManyGames]( - [Leonardo Faria]( - [9.5 / 10](

>My complaints are very minute. I simply loved Hi-Fi Rush. I just wasn’t expecting for such a banger to drop without any buildup, coming from such a talented team, right at the beginning of the year. It’s a magnificent mixture of tons of games from the mid-2000s, resulting in a unique combination of gameplay styles, sense of humor and visuals that easily stands out from the rest of Microsoft’s current exclusives.

-------------

**[XboxEra]( - [Jesse Norris]( - [9.5 / 10](

>Hi-Fi RUSH came out of nowhere and floored me.  It is one of my favorite-looking games, maybe ever.  The combat is sublime, the story is great, and the music just works.  Tango Gameworks has shifted from making ok to good horror games and created one of my favorite action platformers of all time.
