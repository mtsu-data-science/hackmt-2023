###The ""Basic Bastard""/Basic Wardrobe

This is a wardrobe created for someone who is new to the idea of dressing better. It is very simple, basic, and has relatively few items that should be available at most retailers. Note that the name of the ""Basic Bastard"" guide and wardrobe is meant to be tongue-in-cheek humour.

This community actively redirects short simple questions into daily recurring megathreads.  

This is so that a community of 5+ million users doesn't get overwhelmed by the sheer number of posts, and that good substantive quality content doesn't get drowned out. Instead, question what boils down to ""what colors go with navy?"", ""can any identify this jacket from a picture?"" and ""where can I buy a sweater for $50?"" get answered quickly and doesn't clutter up the frontpage of our community. 

Don't let this scare you though! You're more than welcome to post large scale wardrobe rehabilitation posts. Or if you're seeking obscure information, or have a special circumstances that makes an answer in the megathread unlikely. For example, dealing with a medical condition or information on a particular subculture.

How the basic wardrobe has changed: a 2023 supplement to a 2016 MFA staple,,226.0,0.0,,,"There are a lot of newcomers to MFA who don't know where to start, or, folks who used to read MFA back in 2013-2017 then get confused when the pieces that were touted as ""timeless and classic"" aren't seen as very fashionable today. The [Building a Basic Wardrobe]( and [The Basic Bastard]( guides still give great advice for those starting out, and are still relevant today. However, I wanted to offer a *brief* ""2023 Supplement"" so that newcomers, or those interested in how men's fashion has changed in recent years, can be brought up-to-date. 

It's worth noting men's fashion hasn't undergone any *dramatic* changes since 2016. Indigo denim, t-shirts, chinos, leather shoes, sneakers, sweaters, sweatshirts, and jackets all remain wardrobe staples. The main differences include changes to how things fit - specifically, loosening and relaxation of the slim-fitted silhouette.

**1. Pants**

Slim fitting pants used to be the MFA go-to recommendation. Levi's 510 (skinny), [511]( (slim), or J. Crew 484 fit pants were recommended all the time. However, these days, skinny, slim tapered, and even slim pants are generally not recommended. Instead, look for straight fit, regular fit, or relaxed fit pants. For example, Levi's 501 and [505]( are examples of straight fits, and J. Crew's 770 (slim straight) or relaxed fit chinos will look more fashionable. [Wide fitting pants]( can definitely look great, too - check out recent WAYWTs for examples.

Additionally, bigger/higher cuffs that show off tops of sneakers/boots socks are out of style. Small cuffs, no break, or raw hem looks are more popular.

**2. Shirts and Tops**

Similar to the pants, slim and tight shirts aren't highly recommended anymore. This arguably is less important than the pants, and slim fitting shirts can still look fine. But, instead of a [slim-fit]( patterned button down, flannel, or OCBD, consider reaching for a [regular fit one]( Same goes with sweaters and sweatshirts - for example, chunkier, textured sweaters are more in style right now than slim thin merino sweaters.

**3. Shoes**

Sneakers with chunkier profiles rather than flat, sleek silhouettes are more popular in 2023 than they were in 2016. The ""slim minimal white sneakers"" that MFA loved, such as Common Projects Achilles and white converse, are still perfectly wearable today, but chunky sneakers such as [AF1s]( and [New Balances]( (tons of model options) can go nicely with the more relaxed and less slim pants and shirts described above.

Boat shoes, unfortunately, got too engrained in the [frat bro style]( that they became unpopular. Other handsewns like [3-eye lug soles]( [blucher mocs]( or [loafers]( are great alternatives that can be worn in pretty much any outfit that boat shoes can.

**4. Tailoring**

When it comes to suits, sport coats, trousers, dress shirts, and ties, we see a similar loosening of silhouette. For example, [skinny suits with thin lapels]( and [skinny ties]( are dated. [This article is 10 years old but absolutely applies today](

**5. Accessories**

[MFA used to hate crew socks with shorts]( (""Socks with shorts? Generally avoid""). These days, crew socks with shorts is fine. 

MFA used to also hate white socks in pretty much any situation especially if they were visible (the same guide says ""Never white""). [White socks have made a bit of a comeback]( and give a bit of an ivy flair to outfits, especially with loafers. Wear em if you like em.


**In Conclusion**

The ""classic and timeless"" slim-fit everything was a trend, we just didn't realize it. Regular fits, straight fits, looser fits, or relaxed fits will make you look like you're dressing in 2023 rather than in 2016.
