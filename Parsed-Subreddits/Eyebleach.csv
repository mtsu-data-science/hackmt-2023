Black Lives Matter.,,31130.0,0.0,,,"We, the r/Eyebleach community stand in full support of our Black members and with all Black people in America in their fight for the rights that all Americans rightly deserve. Not all racism is hate, the deeply-rooted effects of systemic racism are even more insidious and far-reaching in American society and immediate, drastic change is imperative. 

Sadly, this is most publicly, and devastatingly apparent through the atrocities continually committed against Black Americans by the police. This is not a new problem but, due to the prevalence of video-enabled handheld devices, these atrocities are increasingly being brought to light in ways which make them impossible for society to ignore, most recently with George Floyd and Jacob Blake. Police in America have long been empowered by public funding to enforce the law but they have never been empowered to determine guilt, nor to sentence anyone to abuse nor death. We stand for change.
