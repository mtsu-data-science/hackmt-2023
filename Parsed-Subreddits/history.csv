Simple/Short/Silly History Questions Saturday!,,31.0,0.0,,," 

Welcome to our Simple/Short/Silly history questions Saturday thread!

This thread is for all those history related questions that are too simple, short or a bit too silly to warrant their own post.

So, do you have a question about history and have always been afraid to ask? Well, today is your lucky day. Ask away!

Of course all our regular rules and guidelines still apply and to be just that bit extra clear:

Questions need to be historical in nature. Silly does not mean that your question should be a joke. [r/history]( also has a discord server where you can discuss history with other enthusiasts and experts","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8473994731903076}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.11391308158636093}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.03868740424513817}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.6522513628005981}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.34577080607414246}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0019778248388320208}]]"
Bookclub and Sources Wednesday!,,62.0,0.0,,," Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course itâ€™s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history]( also has a recommended list of things to \[read, listen to or watch\]([","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8966814279556274}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.10205061733722687}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.001267918269149959}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.939698338508606}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.059611640870571136}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0006899764412082732}]]"
