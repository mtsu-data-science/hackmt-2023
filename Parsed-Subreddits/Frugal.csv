**Community Updates**

To begin, I would like to announce that u/Hopeful_Optimism has chosen to step down from their role as the head moderator of r/Frugal. They took over from u/Vorokar last year and have genuinely helped make a positive impact. No matter if the work was public or behind the scenes, they have kept things in check and made certain the ship was running straight. While they will remain on the moderation team in a reduced role, we collectively wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the great work Hopeful has done and the dedication they have shown to our community.

Looking forward, various updates and changes have been proposed or are planned:

&#x200B;

* Frugal Finds Friday: Rule 7 would be suspended on Fridays, providing an opportunity for users to share photos and stories of their finds or hauls outside the traditional megathread.
* Various backend updates and changes.

&#x200B;

This thread also serves as an opportunity to provide community feedback to these ideas. Please let us know if you have any suggestions!

Community Updates & Rule Changes,,21.0,0.0,,,"Hi everybody,

The mod team has been busy making some updates and changes to improve the content standards of the community and to help keep conversations on-topic. The purpose of this post is to help explain the rule changes we have recently implemented. If you have any questions or concerns, please comment below.

# TLDR:

· Modifications to the hauls and finds rule. Hauls and finds will now be allowed in the main feed on Fridays as part of Frugal Finds Fridays.

· Modification to the commercial link rule; restricting fly-by shopping requests. “What is the best/cheapest product?”.

· New political rule to help keep conversations civil and on-topic.

&#x200B;

# So what’s new?

# Hauls and Finds

Our rule involving hauls and finds has been amended to allow hauls or finds to be included in the main feed if they can be easily replicated by readers or if they contain a widely beneficial tip/discussion point. This will help clarify some of the ambiguity we have previously experienced with this rule without limiting certain types of content which create meaningful discussion. For all other hauls and finds, they should either be reserved for the megathread or can be posted in the main feed on Fridays as part of a new program, Frugal Finds Friday.

**Full rule text:**

>To post your haul or find outside the megathread or on a day other than Friday, the content or topic of your haul post must either provide a widely beneficial tip/discussion point or be easy for others to replicate. [r/Frugal]( is an international community that is made up of individuals coming from a wide range of lifestyles, geographic locations, and financial situations. Any hauls posted outside the megathread/Fridays should ideally be relevant to as many people as possible. Singular, one time individual hauls or finds should always be reserved for the megathread/FFF. Posts which should usually be reserved for the megathread include:  
>  
>\- Grocery/food hauls  
>  
>\- Thrift/coupon hauls  
>  
>\- Roadside finds, salvaged goods, or other “one-off” hauls.  
>  
>\- Deals limited to your local area

&#x200B;

# Commercial Links

This rule has been slightly amended to also encompass certain types of low-quality and low effort posts we have observed which seek tips or shopping advice on a specific product to purchase. It is important to note that this change *will not* restrict posts seeking alternatives, DIY solutions, or other conversations which may be discussing a specific product but are still relevant. We are simply looking to avoid the “I need a product, give me a commercial link” posts.

**Full rule text:**

>[r/Frugal]( is intended as a place for discourse or advice and attempts to be a commercial-free zone. Please refrain from:  
>  
>\- Linking to commercial sites, defined as a site which sells products/services through a cart, subscription, or booking appointments/trips. Talking about a site or product is fine, just don't link to it.  
>  
>\- Requesting product suggestions such as the ""cheapest"" or ""best"" product. Posts which generate meaningful discussion are fine but ""fly-by"" shopping requests will be removed.

&#x200B;

# Political & Social Issues

Simply put, r/Frugal is meant as a positive, helpful, and inclusive community. However, we understand that political conversations can be necessary given that politics can have a significant impact on a Frugal lifestyle. While the full text of this rule may seem big and scary, it is ultimately broken down into two parts.

1. Off-topic political content
2. Hostile comments or attacks

&#x200B;

**Section 1.**

We are not restricting any specific topic for discussion under this rule. However, please do not post any political content which would be considered off-topic in a given situation. For example, arguing about COVID-19 vaccines or the president’s latest hairstyle on a post about egg prices would be considered off-topic.

**Section 2.**

This section is divided into three subsections. Please keep in mind that Rule 1 still applies to political content.

1. Attacking, bashing, circle-jerking, or otherwise poop-talking any sort of political figure, opinion, political party, ideology, demographic, protected class, etc. r/Frugal is a diverse community and we are dedicated to keeping this space safe and inclusive. If your comment is disparaging or bashing any particular politician or group, there is a very high chance there are people in the community who fall under that identifying demographic (or support that specific politician). If your comment would be considered a personal attack when the describing noun is replaced with a username, it will be considered a violation and will be treated similar to how civility issues are treated under Rule 1. Please respect other opinions, even if you disagree with them. We ask that you keep political conversations centered on policy, not persons or politics.
2. Blaming an issue on one of the groups mentioned above. This *does not* restrict meaningful conversation about policy, we are simply looking to avoid low-effort partisan circle-jerking. Similarly, broad generalizations would fall under this section of the rule. Examples of this section include comments such as “All of \[insert political ideology\] are bad” or “You can thank President AutoModerator for dinosaur juice prices”. You are welcome to discuss how a specific policy passed or supported by X politician made an impact on your frugal lifestyle, but tone and content matters. Something like “President AutoModerator caused dinosaur juice prices to skyrocket because they passed a law that required the dinosaurs to receive vacation time and the weekends off” would be considered substantial and tonally civil enough to be allowed.
3. Finally, we ask that you refrain from promoting personal or political agendas in an unconstructive or intolerant manner. For example, a post such as “ew gross, no one should eat meat anyways, go vegan” would fall under this rule. A post like “Going vegan is better because tofu is a significantly cheaper source of protein over beef” is fine.

**Full rule text:**

>While meaningful contributions to r/Frugal are encouraged, certain types of political posts are prohibited. Please do not post political content, debates or discussion which are off-topic or not relevant to frugality. Political contributions should be limited to focus on policy, not persons or politics. To keep conversations constructive, postings involving opinions, political affiliations, demographics, protected class, or ethos (character, status, authority) should either be limited to personal, relevant experiences in a given topic and/or tonally civil discussions which are on-topic. Such comments should focus on how the topic being discussed pertains to you, not how you perceive other people’s opinions or motives on the issue. Contributions which disparage or make broad generalizations about the demographics, motives, opinions, political affiliations, or perspectives of other people will be removed (even if not targeted directly towards another user). If a political conversation has reached this point, it is no longer about discussing frugality and is usually off-topic.  
>  
>Furthermore, all political contributions should be kept civil and compliant with Rules 1 and 11. Please refrain from:  
>  
>\- Attacking or bashing political figures, parties, or ideologies. There are other subreddits to engage in these types of discussions. We want r/Frugal to remain a collaborative and constructive place for all.  
>  
>\- Blaming a specific issue on one of these “classes”. This ties in with the point above. Meaningful, on-topic discussion of how a specific policy or decision has made an impact is fine, but please refrain from making broad generalizations or off-topic comments.  
>  
>\- Attacking other users for their perspectives or opinions. Different people have different opinions. Discussion of relevant issues is fine, personal attacks are not.  
>  
>\- Discussing, debating, or pushing social issues which are off-topic.  
>  
>\- Promoting political or personal agendas unconstructively or intolerantly. Again, constructive criticism or suggestions are fine but incivility and gatekeeping is not.","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9815638065338135}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.012787435203790665}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0056487699039280415}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.6948273181915283}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.3038371801376343}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0013355170376598835}]]"
