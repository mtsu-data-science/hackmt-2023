------------------------------------------------



Part of our subreddit's recent transformation includes a new weekly discussion thread! Ask any question you'd like, and people from our community will give you their most honest opinions/answers. Please remember that most usual rules apply.



Important rules:

------------------------------------------------



* No **aftercare/medical questions/advice**

* No **pricing questions/advice**

* Please be kind to your fellow tattoo-lovers, and follow [reddiquette](



Some examples of things to ask the community about:

------------------------------------------------



* Tattoo placement

* Skin tone

* Tattoo subject/style/design

* Recommended tattoo artists in your area

* Pain

* *Anything else you'd like!*



If you're asking about your tattoo, please provide an image of the stencil or final tattoo, rather than elaborately describing it in a paragraph. Also, remember that unless a user has a verified flair, their advice *may not* be coming from a history of tattooing.","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9806303381919861}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.016367865726351738}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0030018030665814877}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.6391780972480774}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.3530687689781189}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.007753107696771622}]]"
