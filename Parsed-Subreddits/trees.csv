"Hi trees! I'm the founder of /r/leaves, and I've promised to ""advertise"" /r/leaves here only twice a year. Today's one of those days. If you've decided maybe it's time to quit, we can help...","New Year's Day is about resolutions for some people, and if you've resolved to quit smoking weed as one of yours, /r/leaves is a part of the trees community made up of 260,000 people who have decided that they need to bring the weed part of their life to a close.

We're not anti-weed at all, we just support people who have decided that while it may have been great in the past, weed no longer serves them in the way it once did. If that's you then you're welcome to come by.

Thanks for letting me get in my one ""advertisement,"" and thanks also for the support /r/trees has always shown for /r/leaves.

Happy New Year!",18722.0,0.0,0.5490297675132751,0.4495990574359894,0.001371165388263762,0.9453834891319275,0.03592369332909584,0.01869284361600876
