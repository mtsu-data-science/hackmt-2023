"If you have thought about going solar, it cost about 1/3 as much to DIY compared to the big solar companies. Here is one of the installs I did on my house.

Shorten the door vs lower the threshold.,,15.0,0.0,,,"The bottom of the door hangs up on the threshold/transition piece. It's a choice between dismounting the door and shave it down, or take a little off the threshold (preferably, off the bottom of the threshold so I don't have to refinish it).

Question: since there are no screws visible, what would be the general rule on securing that threshold, and how horribly bad would it be trying to undo it?

I'm not skilled, and I'm not well-tooled. Looking for guidance on the decision to try it myself or throw some money at it.

Light Fixture Installation Over Sink,,5.0,0.0,,,"I want to install a flush mount light over my kitchen sink. There is a wire installed above the kitchen cabinet already. Can I simply drill a hole large enough to feed the wires through and mount a pan box to the overhead board to support the light fixture?

I am in NB Canada in case anyone knows any specifics in regards to the electrical code.
