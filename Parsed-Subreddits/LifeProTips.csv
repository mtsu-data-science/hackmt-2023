LPT: In most cases you don't need to wash your clothes with hot water. Heating the water takes up almost 90% of the energy expenditure of a washing machine. Most detergents nowadays don't even need high temperatures and work fine in the cold. It's better for your wallet and the environment.,,46575.0,0.0,0.9013219475746155,0.020623525604605675,0.0780545026063919,,,
"LPT: Check on your friends who just had a baby. Ask if they need company, or anything, really. Keep calling them to social events, even if they are unable to attend for a good few months. Their routine has abruptly changed, hence most ""friends"" just vanish.","This is special if it is their first child and they are still learning how this whole new thing of how parenting works, if they live far from family and good safety net, etc.

Coming from a new dad who now feels left out...

Edit: whoa, this has really blown up! I didn't mean to start such a controversy. This isn't about the new kids, new lifestyle that will unfold. Most parents go through a storm and many important aspects of their lives are neglected, friendships bring one of them. My point is: reach out your OG friends, reassure, be near if they need, because they might suddenly be the weakest link for a little while.",42870.0,0.0,0.9688952565193176,0.025111421942710876,0.005993404425680637,0.07430873811244965,0.9246342182159424,0.0010570348240435123
"LPT: Don’t wait until you have “free time” to start a fitness program. Because then when you get busy again, you’ll stop. The best time to start is actually when you’re busy.

"LPT: Use IRS.gov to file your taxes for free if you make less than $73,000","Don't use TurboTax or any of those ridiculous sites that charge you money to file taxes. They are scams in my opinion.
If you make less than $73,000 a year you can go to IRS.gov and pick a provider to file your federal and (sometimes) state taxes for free and it's Easy. 
Don't pay money to get your money from the government!!!",34566.0,0.0,0.8381309509277344,0.01274147816002369,0.14912749826908112,0.011450579389929771,0.004083650186657906,0.9844657182693481
