LPT - No more leaking after peeing!,,7002.0,0.0,,,"There's a bend in the male urethra holding back the last few drops. There's a point between the balls and butthole where you can softly press to straighten the bend and it helps to get rid of those last few drops. 

Tried it and it blew my mind.  Cannot believe this isn't common knowledge

LPT - save pictures of your house from summer time in case you need to sell in the winter,,171.0,0.0,,,"Take pictures of your house in all seasons but especially in summer time. Listing a house with images from winter when itâ€™s covered in snow and obscuring the shrubs, lawn, condition of the roof, etc makes selling the house much more difficult. 

You could create an  email address for your house or file folder to store these seasonal images as well as warranties or receipts for repairs including contractor names, and any maintenance program documents. Good luck!","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8560291528701782}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.14227114617824554}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.001699737855233252}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8997917175292969}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.09844072163105011}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0017675637500360608}]]"
"LPT: Look through your chats with friends. If they're almost entirely about you and your situations, you might killing off a valuable friendship",,44.0,0.0,,,"It's comforting to have that friend you can vent to and life problems certainly don't come in balanced ways, but if you notice that your chats are wildly slanted towards what you want to talk about, most people will grow distant and you may end up losing that friend eventually.

Show some interest in their situations. If they say ""I had a hard day!"", don't respond with ""me too!"" and then launch into details. Spend some quality time getting all the deets and showing sincere empathy. If the opportunity doesn't come to talk about your issue (or if your balance to date is wildly slanted), let it go. Let them end the conversation on a high note of having been heard.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9263927936553955}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.07057260721921921}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.00303458864800632}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.9626120924949646}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.035793907940387726}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0015939401928335428}]]"

Edit: thank you u/AmberRune for teaching us the opt out tool!



Edit 2: Hello everyone! So essentially what the overall real prolife tips in the comments are: 
1a) get an ad blocker if you want to minimize the exposure to ads, but they'll still have your data. 
1b) ublock origin for Firefox or brave browser if you want to keep a chromium browser. 

2) you could just give in and help google personalize your ads better for you

3) even if you opt out of personalized ads, you will still get ads, just not geared towards you. 

4) google isn't the only company gearing ads towards you.","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8555098176002502}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.12812279164791107}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.016367435455322266}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.7375871539115906}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.25883957743644714}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.003573312424123287}]]"
