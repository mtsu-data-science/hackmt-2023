"A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird’s chest.","After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""

The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?""  

""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1500!"" she cried, ""$1500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $50, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1500.""",30426.0,0.0,0.7337860465049744,0.01091296598315239,0.25530099868774414,0.16941775381565094,0.005364445503801107,0.8252177834510803

"Harold got in bed, kissed his lovely wife, and fell into a deep sleep. He awoke before the pearly Gates and St. Peter said..","“You died in your sleep, Harold.”

Harold was stunned. ""I'm dead...?  No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for. Send me back to my wife!”

St. Peter said, ""Perhaps that can be arranged, but there aren’t many open spots right now. You’ve got two alternatives: you can come back to your house as a goldfish or as a hen.”

Harold never liked swimming and thought that perhaps being a hen wouldn't be that bad after all.  The chickens his wife raised just ran around pecking at the ground, no stress,  and at least he’d still be close to her.

Harold replied, ""Okay, then I choose to be a hen.” The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground in his old backyard! Another hen strolled up and said, ""So, you're the new hen, nice to meet you. How’s your first day here?”

""Not bad,"" replied Harold, ""but I have this strange feeling inside like I'm gonna explode!”

""You're ovulating,"" explained the hen. “Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before!”

""Never.."" said Harold.

""Well, just cluck twice and then push.” Harold clucked twice and pushed, and voila, out popped an egg. Harold was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood for the first time. He then clucked twice, pushed, and out came another egg. It felt amazing. He never new it was like this! Just as he was about to lay his third egg, his wife called out to him. “Harold! Harold!”

Happiness filled Harold as he saw her running towards him. Knowing she was there to share this moment, he was overwhelmed by joy.

He clucked once, clucked twice, and suddenly felt his wife smack the back of his head. “Dammit, Harold wake up! You're shitting the bed!”",27176.0,0.0,0.20887364447116852,0.7902105450630188,0.0009157602326013148,0.022480899468064308,0.0028870946262031794,0.9746320247650146
Everyone asked a 100-year-old man and his 98-year-old wife for their health secrets.," 

 The old man said ""I'll tell you my secret. I've been married for 75 years. I promised my wife when we got married that when we quarrel, the loser has to walk for 5 kilometres. So I've been walking 5 kilometres every day for past 75 years! Everyone applauded and asked again ""But how come your wife is very healthy as well?"" The old man answered ""That is another secret. For 75 years every single day she has been following me to make sure I really walk the full 5 kilometres!""",25561.0,0.0,0.9786394834518433,0.017151029780507088,0.004209436941891909,0.39222583174705505,0.6063184142112732,0.0014557886170223355
