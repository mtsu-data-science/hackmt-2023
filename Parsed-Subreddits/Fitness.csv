18M Natural Transformation (Skinny to Muscle),"**Before:** age 18, 5' 11'', 135 pounds

**After:** age 18, 5' 11'', 145 pounds

**Timeframe:** 6 months

**Progress Pic (front):** [**

**Progress Pic (arms):** [**

**Diet:**

*Breakfast:*

* Oatmeal with ground up walnuts and 
* 1 glass of apple juice 

*Lunch:*

* pasta, either with chicken or grated cheese
* salad 
* 2 glasses of soy milk

*Dinner:*

* Various options: chicken/fish/lentils/beans/stir-fry with paneer
* Always with Rice and sometimes an extra naan

*Snacks:*

* Yogurt with fruit

I try to aim for 2500 - 3000 cal everyday (or at least enough that fills me up and ensures I am not overeating) with 100g of protein. I am not taking creatine or steroids.

**Training:**

Since I go to the gym 4 days per week, I follow an upper-lower split. For all my exercises, I perform 3-5 sets and aim for the 5-12 rep range

*Upper:*

* Barbell bench (started with a max of 85 pounds, it is now 170 pounds)
* Incline DB bench (started with 10 pounds 3 x 10, it is now 40 pounds 3 x 10)
* DB shoulder press (started with 15 pounds 3 x 10, it is now 40 pounds 3 x 10)
* Lateral raises (just incorporated these into my routine and don't have a before/after)
* Tricep cable pushdowns  (started with 15 pounds 3 x 10, it is now 35 pounds 3 x 10)
* Overhead tricep cable extensions (started with 10 pounds 3 x 10, it is now 30 pounds 3 x 10)
* Pull ups (couldn't do 1 when first starting, now can do 10 unassisted)
* Hammer curls (started with 15 pounds 3 x 5, it is now 30 pounds 3 x 10)
* Barbell bicep curls (just incorporated these into my routine and don't have a before/after)

With my upper body, I ensure I'm hitting every muscle group, however given the large number of exercises I sometimes need to cut out 1-2 exercises when I am short on time (e.g. alternating between DB shoulder press and incline, cable pushdowns and cable extensions)

*Lower:*

* Barbell Squats (started with DB squats 20 pounds 3 x 10. My max barbell squat is now 195 pounds)
* Leg extensions (started with 50 pounds 3 x10. It is now 130 pounds 3 x 10)
* Leg press *(*started with no plates 3 x 10. It is now 370 pounds 3 x 8)
* Seated leg curl (started with 30 pounds 3 x 10. It is now 120 pounds 3 x 10)
* Standing leg curl (started with 10 pounds 3 x 10. It is now 50 pounds 3 x 8)
* Calf raises (Can't remember my before/after)

These exercises sufficiently target my quads and hamstrings. 

**Next steps**

* My goal is to bench and squat 225 by the spring.
* My lower body is weaker than my upper body, so I will continue to work hard with my legs.",928.0,0.0,0.9007747173309326,0.09736720472574234,0.0018580028554424644,0.981590211391449,0.013984031043946743,0.004425738472491503
Should I go heavier weight with less reps on squat or lighter weight with higher reps? For more explosiveness when pitching off the mound in baseball,"
I lift for baseball and pitching and Currently when I squat I stick around sets of 3-5 with as heavy as I can get for those sets however I was wondering if I should be doing more sets of higher reps with lighter weight. Would that be more beneficial to getting more velo of the mound or should I keep sticking to strength and stay with the heavy weight for more sets. My current squat max is around 385 and my 5 rep is 310-315 and 3 rep is 335-345.",614.0,0.0,0.9429441094398499,0.05424344912171364,0.0028124740347266197,0.9521251320838928,0.04527268186211586,0.0026021399535238743
Cardio with mouth closed vs. Normal Breathing?,"Really curious about this.

When I use to train(boxing), it was suggested to run with your mouth piece. I assume this is because when you're gasping for air, you'll have to get use to the feeling of a mouth piece being in the way.

Either way, what do you all think about that? are there any benefits?",564.0,0.0,0.9654716849327087,0.008918650448322296,0.025609657168388367,0.9221365451812744,0.07101716846227646,0.006846289150416851
