"If someone has been muscular in the past, does he gain muscle mass more easily as someone who has not gained muscle before?","Lets say there are identical twins, one of them gains a lot of muscle while the other doesn't. Now the muscular one stops working out for two years and both twins have the same body's again. Now both start training and doing exactly the same, same workout plan, same diet. Will the person who has been muscular before gain muscle mass more easily than the other one?
I'm asking this because I hear and read about this phenomenon and people calling it 'muscle memory'. I think muscle memory means something else but I am still wondering if this phenomenon exists.",5711.0,0.0,0.9536311626434326,0.012165413238108158,0.03420346602797508,0.6311542987823486,0.008366962894797325,0.36047878861427307
Why are coastlines crinkly near the poles but smooth in the tropics?,"I've noticed from playing [Worldle]( that you can instantly tell how close an island is to the poles by how crinkly its coastline is.

Everything in the Arctic or Antarctic has intricate crinkly edges: Svalbard, Ellesmere, the Falklands, the Kerguelen Islands.

Tropical islands look totally different, smooth and rounded: Sri Lanka, Barbados, Nauru.

Why's that?

Edit: I'm getting notifications every few minutes about glaciers, erosion and Slartibartfast, and almost all of the comments vanish so no one but me can see them. But thank you for all of the answers, I am feeling thoroughly educated!",5251.0,0.0,0.9338126182556152,0.008034765720367432,0.05815255269408226,0.9586108326911926,0.03161092847585678,0.009778142906725407
