"My (27F) boyfriend (28M) of 7 years wants to take a 1 year long ""break""","Hi. I'm sorry for my spelling as English is not my first language. Me (27F) and my BF (28M) have been together since we were 20 y/o and for the most part our relationship was pretty good. We can comunicate pretty well our wants and needs so it's been a very healthy relationship.

A couple of days ago I noticed something was bothering him and I asked. He said he doesn't feel as good as he used to. He's not ok with where he is now in his life. He doesn't like his job, his economics, his life basically. The only thing he said is good in his life is me, and that doesn't make him feel fulfilled.

We've been talking nonstop this past few days, also we have cried too much. At the beginning I was scared because I didn't want the relationship to end but the more we talk the more I feel I don't deserve this situation. I know is not a me problem, is him, his life, his goals. I cannot think for him, I can't be happy for him.

I'm exhausted, at the end of every conversation he ends up telling me that even though he wants to discover himself, the only thing he's sure is that he doesn't wanna live without me, but then the next morning he wakes up confused with what he wants again. He's came up with this idea of take a 1 year long ""break"" so he can find himself and then come back to me.

I honestly think that's awful, and I told him that I love him so much and probably in a year I will still love him the same but I don't deserve that, I won't be sitting with my arms folded just waiting, I'll probable recent him a lot, so that won't work for me. If he stays he stays and commit to work things out in therapy, and if he leaves it's done.

He said the most important thing for him is my happiness and I deserve a concrete answer of what his choice will be, he wants time to think about it, like a month. But now I'm asking myself what do I want? Honestly him pulling this stunt destroyed somehow a little of my trust in him, so I don't know if now should I leave either way.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My bf of seven years is confused about what he wants in like and wants to take a 1 year long break, now I'm dissapointed and asking myself if I should leave the him.",1677.0,0.0,0.9626290798187256,0.018382735550403595,0.01898818463087082,0.94258713722229,0.022360067814588547,0.03505278378725052
Boyfriend 20M is planning dream holiday with his female best friend 20F and I 20F wasn’t invited. What are my next moves?,"
20F, 20M, been dating for 1 year

About a month ago my boyfriend brought up plans to go to his favourite country for a few days to see his favourite band with his female best friend who also likes said band. 

I thought it was odd that I wasn’t included in the plans but I brushed it off as maybe he just forgot to ask. Then after about the third or fourth time he brought it up it became clear that not only was he not going to ask, he probably never even imagined me there in the first place. I told him this upset me and he sheepishly invited me. 

I don’t like the band but he and bff would be doing other stuff whilst they were there, PLUS this band would have been touring in our country at a later date so I don’t know why he didn’t invite me to his dream holiday and then do the concert with bff at a later date? 

Other subs have been very divided on this but I lowkey feel like he’s crossing a line here. I don’t want to be that controlling gf who doesn’t let her bf have any friends and is super jealous but I also don’t want him to think he can disrespect relationship boundaries. 

What are my next moves? Apart from saying “just break up” 

Tl;dr boyfriend is planning dream holiday with female best friend and I was only invited after I brought it up. It feels weirdly intimate and I’m not happy with it

Edit: I’m going to delete this soon bc I don’t want him to see it (he has Reddit lol). We talked and he agreed that he wouldn’t be happy if the situation was reversed so I’m not entirely sure where things are gonna go from here. We’ll talk properly in person in a couple of days.",1587.0,0.0,0.3776406943798065,0.008480590768158436,0.6138786673545837,0.7560606598854065,0.24248315393924713,0.0014562119031324983
Living with fiancé not going well,"My fiancé (M 32) and I (F 33) bought a home together within the last 6 months. Prior to this we were long distance (about 2 hours from each other) for 8-9 years. We both had our own things we were working on in that time- academically and professionally. We both didn’t think we’d be that way for that long but that was how it worked out.

 I wanted to be married before buying a place together but that didn’t happen and I am actually happy about that now because I’m seeing  that this relationship might actually not be something I want to continue.

I always thought of him as a great life partner. For the most part he is supportive of me and I of him. Our communication has not been great but we are working on that. He is really handy with things around the house- able to fix plumbing, electrical, likes to work on different things. I always knew this about him. In buying this house we had to paint the whole place top to bottom. Originally we were going to paint it ourselves. I was really down for it and wanted to do it, I knew it would take a bit. That was our plan to paint it ourselves. Then he decided he didn’t want to do it. I couldn’t paint it all myself so hired a painter to do it and paid $6500 (excluding the basement). Now I’m realizing his whole thing is he *likes* to do all that stuff above but he *doesnt really want to/is lazy* and will take ages to do something. 

I don’t want to have to be like his mom and keep asking for something to be done. Mom is not a role I want to be at all. We went without a mirror in our downstairs bathroom for months when he had the materials needed to hang it and just didn’t do it until Christmas since we were having family here. This is the bathroom I primarily use because I don’t want to disturb him on his days off in the morning getting up early and getting ready. He knows this and knew there was no mirror in there for a good 4-5 months since the painter was there and had removed it. 

He isn’t thoughtful or caring, writing this and thinking about things I am realizing this. There is no caring from him at all. I was sick in November and not once in the time I was sick did he offer to make any meals or walk our dog (originally my dog  who is still young and just about a year and a half). At one point my mom invited me to her place and let me rest for the day there. I slept the whole day because I was so tired and really not getting any rest at home. 

Christmas we hosted for the first time - he didn’t help at all, in fact never once did he ask anyone if they want drinks, pass around appetizers, or anything he just sat there. I made the whole Turkey dinner with fixings, made lasagna and 3 homemade desserts, etc. After the whole day of preparing, cooking, hosting, he didn’t even offer to take the dog out for me that night. 

I feel like if you really care for someone and love them you shouldn’t have to ask them to do basic caring things.. he should just do them. 

If I didn’t make 95% of our meals we wouldn’t eat. We do occasional take out and on days he is off and I’m working he has cooked a few times. Sometimes we will have leftovers from what I’ve made the night or two before. On weekends when I’m off I’m always the one making us breakfast. He never once has gotten up and made it. He doesn’t typically eat breakfast on his own, even during the week (he’s up at 5 am and out the door at 5:30) But he knows I do and he has never been thoughtful and just made us both breakfast.  I’ve made his lunches too because I feel bad he won’t eat during the day - but this too he could get up and make for himself early or make the night before.

 I’m tired of leaving the house to go to work, the dishwasher has all clean dishes in it ready to be put away, and I come home and the clean dishes are still in there with the dirty ones in the sink. I can undoubtedly tell you where he is the moment I walk in the door. Laying on the couch with his phone glued to his hands. It’s literally the same position he is in every night I get in from work or anytime I am out and come back home. I could make a bet and win every time that that is where he is going to be. 

Anyway; for all that have made it this far - thank you for reading and my question for you is what would you do in this case? Would you call it quits? I can’t see he rest of my life being like this. I don’t feel like I can depend on him. If he is this way now, I can’t even imagine throwing a baby into the mix, just thinking down the road. I can see it all now. I mean he *once* got up in the morning to take the dog out for me and this was after asking him to because I was running late that morning. Besides that I walk the dog day and night. I don’t want to have to ask him to walk the dog. I just want him to do it.  I have told him this. I just feel so over every aspect of this. I feel like I’m the only one doing things here and is is really getting tiresome. 

TL;DR - bought a house together, were long distance previously, living together has made me doubt this relationship and if it should continue",1576.0,0.0,0.02454465441405773,0.004327090457081795,0.9711282849311829,0.8937464952468872,0.10469020158052444,0.001563350553624332
UPDATE: Former friend wants to rekindle our friendship after suffering a bereavement- I’m reluctant,"Original post



UPDATE:

I (27F) was blown away by all your advice and responses so I just wanted to update you all- I followed the advice of the majority on here and let my former friend (23F) down as gently as possible.

I told her how sorry I am for her loss and that I can’t imagine how hard things are for her but I couldn’t see us going back to the way we were. 
I said how a lot of hurtful stuff went on and how I don’t think I can offer the type of support she needs at this point in time.

She actually reacted much better than expected and wished me good luck with everything. Which broke my heart a bit as, despite the difficulties, we did have some great times too. But I know deep down it was toxic- someone mentioned being an ‘emotional sponge’ which was super accurate lol. I am one. I do tend to put other’s feelings ahead of my own because I know how it feels to feel low and don’t want anyone else to feel that way.

Thank you all so much for all the advice and responses, I’m honestly blown away by how many I got. I’m trying so hard to get better at setting boundaries and sticking up for myself.. it’s hard due to my experiences growing up but today was a start at least. Thank you all again, I definitely feel like I’ve made the right decision despite it being a hard one.

TL;DR: I followed the advice given on here and ended the friendship in question.",1545.0,0.0,0.3699039816856384,0.006987177301198244,0.6231088042259216,0.24705956876277924,0.7516363263130188,0.0013040732592344284
My (21F) boyfriend (22M) made me sit in the back so his ex(24F) can have the front seat,"I(21F) have been together with my boyfriend(22M) for about two years now. Things have been alright, I cannot complain about anything in particular, except that at the start of our relationship, he kept mentioning his ex girlfriend a lot. Ex: ""oh, my ex had different *body feature* than you do"" or ""my ex had the same bra as you do"" and so on. You best believe in never wore that bra again, I didn't need to know that information. 

They were together when he was 15 and she was 17.  At one point I got tired of me being somewhat compared to his ex girlfriend. Also, besides him mentioning her in certain situations, he told me that she's a bad person and that she took advantages of his immaturity. His friends told me that she's not that great either and I've got to see her once, unexpectedly in a store while shopping for groceries. I bumped into her while looking for something, and she snapped at me for not looking where I was going. That was kinda my fault, I am clumsy sometimes. 

Yesterday me and my boyfriend decided to go back to our hometown. Apparently, she moved towns as well and lives quite close to us. We were putting our bags in the car when my boyfriend saw her down the street and called her name. They hugged and he asked her what she's doing, how has she been and she told us that she's going back home but has no ride, so she has to figure something out. My boyfriend offered to drive her as well, which I didn't have a problem with, until he told me to go sit in the back so she can stay in the front.

The whole ride i felt inexistent, uncomfortable and miserable. My boyfriend didn't check on me, he only talked with her and her as well, only with him. And for those who'll probably say ""Well, why didn't you say something yourself?"" I tried to, but everytime i was cut off by her, and my boyfriend didn't notice, or he acted like he didn't. I don't even know which is worse.

 I feel betrayed, and shocked since he never showed interests in other women, especially his ex girlfriend. What do I do now?

tl:dr: me and my boyfriend went back to our hometown and his ex came with us. I sat in the back seat while she, in the front. They talked the whole time and never once payed any attention to me, even though I tried to participate in the conversation as well.",1442.0,0.0,0.8184747099876404,0.013791793026030064,0.16773347556591034,0.023217450827360153,0.9760497808456421,0.0007327769417315722
