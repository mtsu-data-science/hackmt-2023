Did I cheat?,,28.0,0.0,,,"Since about 3 years ago, I [23F] have been in a sort of fuck buddy relationship with one of my closest friends[24M]. None of the members of our friend group know, it's just between the two of us. Anyway, about a year ago, I started liking someone [25M], he liked me too, so I ended things sexually with the fuck buddy and focused my attention on the new guy. 

Then [25M] told me he didn't want to be in a relationship, he doesn't want to be committed and all that. He said when he gets in a relationship, he just does everything to get out of it ASAP. I thought it was stupid, cause at the point he was telling me, he was constantly coming to my room, getting me stuff, chatting me constantly... Pretty much, everything you do in a relationship(yes, including sex).... But he says he's single. 
It's been a year now, we're still doing all the same stuff and he still says he's single.

Recently, my fuck buddy friend found out that I'm still technically single (he backed off thinking I was in a relationship). 
So, one day, when we were alone, he does stuff to turn me on and we have sex. Now I'm wondering, did I cheat? Am I a terrible person? What do I do now?


TL:DR Was fuck buddies with a friend for 2 years then ended that, and I'm now in a situationship with a new guy(who constantly says he's still single). I then had sex with fuck buddy.

My (30f) bf (38m) makes friends with strangers on our dates,,26.0,0.0,,,"I’ve been seeing my bf for six months now. He’s very friendly and outgoing so it was easy for me to introduce him to my circle of friends. He only has one or two close friends that live nearby. 

He really likes when we go on dates, interacting with strangers. Like talking to the musicians we just saw perform afterwards and inviting new friends to our table. For me, I have a job where I talk to strangers all day for a living, so while I’m good at it, I don’t want to be doing it on my time off because it’s taxing and feels like work. 

He will talk about being invited to strangers houses and having a lovely dinner with them and he seems to really like it. I don’t want to take that away from him since he doesn’t have a lot of close friends, but I don’t want to be a part of it either. I’m not sure what to say to him.

I (37f) started a new job and I'm not sure how to address the casual racism from a coworker (55m) without making my work life miserable,,10.0,0.0,,,"I (37f) work in a correctional facility, so all filters are pretty much off despite all the sensitivity training. Myself and my coworker (55m) are both white. He is not my boss, but he's been there a long time and has seniority. Everyone else respects him. I just started six months ago.

We have a lot in common, but he and I are pretty much opposites when it comes to politics and social issues. I avoid these topics, and most of the time we get along really well. But sometimes he brings up stuff out of the blue and I need advice on what I should say because I am kind of paralyzed when it happens.

For example, when recounting interactions with black people, he uses the stereotypical accent for black people. I called him on it once, and he insisted that that's how all the guys who come through our facility talk, white or black, and that he didn't mean anything by it. When I said, flat-out, that his imitation was racist, he said, ""well that's how they talk, I'm not being racist if I am just imitating their actual accent, am I?"" I did not know how to respond because I was so taken aback. I regret not saying more. He also used the term ""yo-boys"" during this interaction, which I didn't even address in my speechlessness.

Another time, he asked me what I thought about diversity rules at work that say workers can wear dreads or braids without discrimination. I told him that it was fine with me and that just because it doesn't apply to me doesn't mean it doesn't help others, but he said it bugged him because he didn't like diversity ""being pushed on"" him.

It stresses me out. I want to speak up more, because he does listen to me when I talk to him. I'm not so naive to think I'll change his mind, but I have to deal with him every day and he seems to really like me, so it seems possible that I could at least make him think twice. How can I reply in a way where he won't immediately dismiss me as his liberal enemy, lol? FWIW I hate it when he puts me in that situation.

Also, before anyone recommends reporting him....if I reported every racist or questionable thing I heard every day at work I'd be reporting almost everyone. Also, it would spread like wildfire and my life at work would be hell because most people there are exactly like him. Yes it's depressing.

I'm honestly just trying to live my f*ckin life, man.

tl;dr: An older coworker keeps making casual racist remarks or statements. I am new to this job (I need this job) and he seems to like/trust me. What are some good ways to call him out without totally alienating him and everyone else at work?","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9454402923583984}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.051558952778577805}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0030007753521203995}]]","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.5067947506904602}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.4854359030723572}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.007769355550408363}]]"
"My [24F] jealous boyfriend [25M] of 3 years wants to know everything about me (where I go), but he has a problem with sharing locations on our iPhones.",,15.0,0.0,,,"Hello, I recently got my first iPhone and I shared locations with my family. Like a year or more ago, I asked my boyfriend, who he always wanted me to get an iPhone, if he would share locations with me once I got it. He said ""yeah"" but I remember it did not sound very convincing.

Two days ago, I tried sharing my location with my boyfriend (just temporarily, for 24 hours) and so did he - I asked him ,,Oh, so you do want to share locations?"" and he replied ,,You don´t trust me?""

.... and it sounded weird. The whole thing is weird to me. Because he is the jealous type of a person, I have to tell him whenever I leave the house or wherever I go when I am gone to university during the week - *,,I am going to lunch now/ I am going to the lecture now/ I am back at the dorm / I am going to the library""* etc. In the beginning of our relationship I made him tell me those things too - If I have to do it, so will he. But he usually only goes from home to work and from work to home. *(we don´t live together yet).*

It was clear that he does not want to share it and I think it´s quite suspicious. I don´t have nothing to hide, but this makes me think he does. Idk. I am not a jealous person, I don´t crave sharing my location with him, but this just does not seem compatible with his personality. Why would he not want that?

Also, I found out like a year and a half ago that he can sometimes leave work for a while and then come back when he needs it (he works in agriculture). So combining this fact with the non-shared location got me overthinking things.

 \*\*TL;DR; : My boyfriend is the quite jealous type, we text each other every time when we basically change places (leave house, come back home etc.), but he does not want to share the location on our iPhones.  \*\*.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9708839058876038}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.02617512457072735}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0029409343842417}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.6910879611968994}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.3077825605869293}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.001129506970755756}]]"
Boyfriend met a girl off of a dating app. Says they only kissed + is extremely apologetic. How to move past this?,,101.0,0.0,,,"Hi. I’m 26F, my boyfriend is 26M. We have been dating for five years and live together/have a cat/have talked about getting married. I thought things were going well.

Then I noticed he was staying up on his phone lately, and I caved and checked his texts/call log last night. He’s been texting and FaceTiming another girl (who’s in her early 20s) for the past month. By the texts I read, they’ve been on several dates and are very flirty. He met her on a dating app that isn’t on his phone anymore. Last night, he was making plans with her for Sunday.

I’m totally shocked, and heartbroken, and so, so angry. I confronted him when he woke up and he owned up and apologized immediately. He also texted the girl the truth and then blocked her. He said they did not have sex, but admitted they did kiss “a few times”. Most of their dates were during the day. He says he has no feelings for this girl though and that he did it for the validation. (He says he’s been feeling unsure of himself since finishing his graduate program/not being in school anymore. Obviously that’s no excuse, but that was his answer when I asked why he needed more validation.)

He swears it will never happen again, and I want it to work out. I can’t imagine life without him.

How can we move past this?

TL;DR: Boyfriend was going on dates with another girl. He blocked her since I found out, and swears they never did more than kiss. Why would he do this?
