I am an ex-welder turned Offensive Security analyst (ethical hacker) AmA!,,4.0,0.0,,,"Hello! I am currently an Offensive Security analyst (also known as Pentester, ethical hacker or red teamer). I specialize in Web and network penetration testing. 

My job is mainly about finding security holes within my companie's software and exploiting them.

I have got into this field autodidactically. I have been teaching and researching ethical hacking by myself for roughly 8 years prior to 2020 and have gotten enough skills to get into the field officially. Before this I was a welder who specialized in beer brewing equipement. The only official diploma I have is a GED!

If you have questions about my self-learning path, Cybersecurity or even about my transition from traditional labour into the tech industry, AmA! :)","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9389278888702393}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.05858782306313515}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.002484259894117713}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.5714549422264099}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.42698654532432556}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0015585117507725954}]]"
