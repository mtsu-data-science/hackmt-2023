"I’m Bill Gates, and I’m back for my 11th AMA. Ask Me Anything.","I recently found out that I’m going to become a grandfather this year and spent some time thinking about [what matters as we head into 2023](

Feel free to ask what I’m excited about in the year ahead, our work at the foundation, or anything else.

I was Scott from Scott’s Cheap Flights. Now I’m Scott from Going. I’m a professional cheap flight expert here to help your 2023 travel plans.,"I have a weird and wonderful job: I find cheap flights to help people travel more.

It all began on Reddit [8 years ago]( after I found a $130 roundtrip flight to Milan, and because I lack creative genius I gave my email list the most obvious name I could think of: Scott’s Cheap Flights.

Eight years later, I’m titillated for what that little startup has now become: [Going](

**Rebrand Stuff**

Look, the name Scott’s Cheap Flights worked great when it was just me. But today there are 65 people on the team (and [hiring]( and it is immensely unfair and embarrassing and guilt-inducing every time a member writes in “thanks Scott!” for a cheap flight that 64 of my teammates helped them get.

So we decided to switch to a new look and name that’s about all of us, not just one person.

Our mission to help people travel more and stop overpaying for flights is still the same. And the best part of my workday is hearing those real-life cheap flights success stories, especially from Redditors including: (all fares below are roundtrip, not Spirit)

* [u/Thedishwasher3]( Tokyo for $490 nonstop
* [u/Actuarial\_type]( Amsterdam for $410
* [u/Travelmore\_magic]( Paris for $350
* [u/Worldly\_Economist686]( Greece for $480

(If we’ve helped you get a cheap flight, let me know! I want to celebrate you.)

I know rebrands can be polarizing—I don’t begrudge anyone who wishes it stayed SCF. I genuinely want to hear your thoughts about Going, the logo, the new look. Even negative feedback is welcome; it shows you care. The team has been working *extremely* hard for months, and we’re so excited to finally share with y’all.

(One final note I’d be remiss not to mention: If anyone had license to be upset about the name change it’s me, Scott, and I’m ecstatic about it.)

**Cheap Flights Stuff**

You may not care at all about the rebrand and just here to talk cheap flights and I hear you! It’s my favorite topic too. Ask me about:

* my [2022 travel predictions]( (I went 12 for 17, a gentleman’s C)
* my [13 travel predictions for 2023](
* how flights are getting cheaper after last summer’s surge
* whether cookies/incognito browsers change fares
* what days are cheapest for flights
* what Goldilocks Windows are and why they’re the secret to cheap flights
* the most common flight myths/misconceptions
* my favorite deals we found members in 2022 (all roundtrip, not Spirit)
   * Hawaii $177 from west coast, $399 from NYC
   * Costa Rica $207
   * Tokyo $316
   * Paris $248 (record low)

I'm a dad who quit his job to make board games with my wife. We have now sold over $3 million in games. Ask me anything!,"In 2015 my wife and I created a board game as a side hobby. It did way better than we expected so we took a risk and left our jobs to make games full time. We have now created 6 games, sold over $3 million in revenue, and we sell on Amazon, Kickstarter, and in stores.

Ask me anything about making board games, quitting my job, working from home, or anything else!

"I’m Brett Murphy, a ProPublica reporter who just published a series on 911 CALL ANALYSIS, a new junk science that police and prosecutors have used against people who call for help. They decide people are lying based on their word choice, tone and even grammar — ASK (or tell) ME ANYTHING","PROOF: 

For more than a decade, a training program known as 911 call analysis and its methods have spread across the country and burrowed deep into the justice system. By analyzing speech patterns, tone, pauses, word choice, and even grammar, practitioners believe they can identify “guilty indicators” and reveal a killer.

The problem: a consensus among researchers has found that 911 call analysis is scientifically baseless. The experts I talked to said using it in real cases is very dangerous. Still, prosecutors continue to leverage the method against unwitting defendants across the country, we found, sometimes disguising it in court because they know it doesn’t have a reliable scientific foundation.

In reporting [this series]( I found that those responsible for ensuring honest police work and fair trials — from police training boards to the judiciary — have instead helped 911 call analysis metastasize. It became clear that almost no one had bothered to ask even basic questions about the program.

[Here’s the story]( I wrote about a young mother in Illinois who was sent to prison for allegedly killing her baby after a detective analyzed her 911 call and then testified about it during her trial. For instance, she gave information in an inappropriate order. Some answers were too short. She equivocated. She repeated herself several times with “attempts to convince” the dispatcher of her son’s breathing problems. She was more focused on herself than her son: I need my baby, she said, instead of I need help for my baby. [Here’s a graphic that shows how it all works]( 
The program’s chief architect, Tracy Harpster, is a former cop from Ohio with little homicide investigation experience. The FBI helped his program go mainstream. When I talked to him last summer, Harpster defended 911 call analysis and noted that he has also helped defense attorneys argue for suspects’ innocence. He makes as much as $3,500 — typically taxpayer funded — for each training session.

"Hey Reddit! 8 years ago, after 2 close friends died of cancer, I quit my job and started travelling around the world on a motorcycle. In Dec 2021, after riding across 3 continents, I found out I had cancer. Here to answer any questions about travelling, cancer..and talk about life’s irony.","Hello!
I am Paolo, Italian born but Australian citizen since 2010. 
Seven years ago I quit my job, sold everything I had and embarked in a trip around the world on a motorcycle. Rode across 3 continents and 50 countries, clocking over 200000km (125k mi) with the same bike. I got stuck on a Greek Island during Covid and then flew back to Australia in December 2021, to continue my journey around the world.
After landing in Sydney, i went to the dealer to pick my bike up. 
The same night I had to rush to the hospital for some severe bleeding.
I had no symptoms beforehand, hence the shock in finding out what was growing inside of me.
After a brief examination in the ER, I was told I had stage 2 COLON cancer.
I fell into a spiral of dark thoughts and I felt that my life was over. 
It took me 2 months just to process the information mentally, then I started my cancer therapy.
I begun radiotherapy and chemotherapy afterwards. 
The effects that therapy had on my body were severe but the hospital staff, the ocean and motorcycling helped me keeping my mental health in a good state.
On Dec 21st 2022, i had my surgery to remove the cancer, and i m now cancer free. 
It’s a long battle, and I m still trying to recover from the massive surgery, but at least i got rid of the big lump growing in my intestine for now.
The irony of it all is that the reason why I started travelling in the first place was because I didn’t want to wake up one day and realise I spend my life piling up money to buy things that I didn’t need, instead of enjoying the moment and cherish my youth and health.



SHORT HEALTH BACKGROUND
There’s no Cancer History running in my family. I m the first and only one.
Most of my life I ve been very attentive to my diet. 
No sodas, no fast food, no junk food.
i’m mostly vegetarian, meaning that I eat everything (meat and fish) but 70% of my weekly intake is veggies, fruits and carbs.
I never had a problem health-wise and I had been conducting a stress free life for most of my existence.
I’ve been exercising for over 30 years, playing several sports at competitive level.
I ran blood work yearly and all values were perfect. 
I was considered physically “athletic” and in perfect health conditions right before the moment of my diagnosis. 
No signs of fatigue or any other symptoms before the “bleeding episode” that lead me to the diagnose.
Basically I was the last person that everybody thought would get something like this. 



MOTORCYCLE:
I rode a KTM 1190 adventure for the whole trip across 3 continents.
It has now 190000 km (120k mi).
No mechanical or electrical issues in the whole trip.
I now ride a KTM 890 adventure.
So far I put on over 35000km (22k mi) across two continents.
