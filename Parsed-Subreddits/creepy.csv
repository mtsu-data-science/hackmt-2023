Introducing Community Awards to r/Creepy!,,1103.0,0.0,,,"Hello r/Creepy!  


We're super excited to announce that we have been chosen for testing the new Community Awards feature!   


* **So what exactly** ***are*** **community awards?**

[Community Awards]( are awards specific to each subreddit, that are awardable via Reddit coins. They're available in the official web UI (This includes both old reddit, and new reddit), and the official Reddit apps.

* **What's the difference between Community Awards and the normal Silver, Gold and Platinum?**

Pretty much the main difference is the fact that you get no benefits from community awards, other than the actual award on your post. You do not receive any benefits (something i personally hope they add are benefits) from being given community awards, so you do not receive Premium nor any coins. The main point of awards is to give the receiving user a sense of pride and accomplishment. You can donate either anonymously or from your username, and can optionally add a private message 

* **Well, what are these awards?**

First off, the mods here at r/Creepy ARE NOT graphic designers, so we didn't create any custom to this subreddit. We know it may be upsetting to some of you, but let's face it - do you really want some crappy stick man as an award? Nope. So, we are using 3 of the default award designs (**If you are willing to contribute, and make a custom design for an award, feel free to!)**. As follows:

&#x200B;

**1. Certified Creepy (Pitchfork) Award (300 Coins)**

&#x200B;

[Certified Creepy \(Pitchfork\) Award \(300 Coins\)](

&#x200B;

**2. ""So Creepy I Grabbed Popcorn"" Award (500 Coins)**

&#x200B;

[\\""So Creepy I Grabbed Popcorn\\"" Award \(500 Coins\)](

&#x200B;

  
**3. ""So Creepy It Blew My Mind"" (600 Coins)**

&#x200B;

[\\""So Creepy It Blew My Mind\\"" \(600 Coins\)](

&#x200B;

# Moderator Exclusive Award(s):

There is also a Moderator exclusive award. Moderators accumulate 20% of coins spent on Community Awards in this subreddit, which in turn, we can use to give out Moderator Exclusive awards! **WHICH DO ACTUALLY HAVE A BENEFIT (THAT BENEFIT BEING PREMIUM).** So, basically, the more you users award posts with community awards - the more the moderators can award high-quality posts, with actual benefits.
