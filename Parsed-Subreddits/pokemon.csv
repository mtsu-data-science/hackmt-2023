It's been one year since the release of Pokenon Legends: Arceus. What do you guys think of the game?,,646.0,0.0,,,"One year ago today Pokemon Legends: Arceus was released, as it was released on January 28, 2022. This game had several changes in gameplay compared to other Pokemon games, such as in battles and how to catch pokemon.

What do you guys think of it? Did you like the gameplay changes? How do you compare it to other games like ""Sword  and Shield"" and ""Scarlet  and Violet""?","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8763275742530823}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.12199164181947708}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0016807926585897803}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.5716615319252014}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.42695021629333496}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0013882197672501206}]]"
Pokemon Scarlet Violet Clive Theory,,663.0,0.0,,,"Honestly, I was completely blown away by this 


For context, if some of yall are reading even in case of spoilers, there's this really cool kid who shows up throughout the game to help you fight team star. He's got spunk and swag and I the swankiest guy ever right. Like, he's the kind of guy Brock wishes he was. 


Anyways, somethint seemed really suspicious about him. Could a kid really be this cool? I mean, it's the same pokemon company that gave us Barry so I'm pretty sure being cool isn't possible for 10 year old boys in this universe. 

Anyways, I may be going out on a limb here. But, for some reason, every time you talk to him, it mentions something about Clavell. He even has a similar head shape. 

I'm no saying they're the exact same character but the evidence is huge. 

This is even further proves at the end when Clavell pretends to be Clive just to battle you. Administration battling a student in the front of the school would definitely get him fired. But if he stole the identity of the coolest kid in town, neither of them would get punished. 

So, I guess my theory here, and it's a mindblowing one, is that Clive actually WAS Clavell the whole time.  He wasn't trying to steal his identity. I'm not entirely sure how Clive, a cool kid, could pretend to be a grandpa just so he could become principal, but it makes sense why Clavell dresses up as Clive in the endgame. If he wasnt a kid, then why does his Clive costume look so convincing?

What are your thoughts? Do you think Clive and Clavell are secretly the same person all along? If so, how did this ten year old coolboy fool the School in allowing him to be principal?

Edit: someone mentioned the possibility that Clavell is Clive's dad. Clive Clavell. It still doesn't explain why he would cosplay as his son at the last minute though. Unless, is Clavell an abusive father who was going to use his own son to try and not get in trouble at work?","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9733524918556213}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.02333931066095829}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.003308170475065708}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.8559374213218689}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.13947021961212158}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.004592390730977058}]]"
My first Pokemon merch,,332.0,0.0,,,"I found my very first Pokemon merch ever while visiting home and wanted to share. My family was poor when I was young so this was also one of the very few toys my parents actually bought for me (as opposed to hand-me-downs). [It’s a plastic Pikachu piggy bank]( (there’s a slit to insert coins/ cash, and a lid in the bottom that can be removed to take out savings). And I loved it so much I would hug it while sleeping. After moving a few times I thought I no longer had it; but here was my beloved, collecting dust in a corner of my old closet. Still looking good after all these years!","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.7975962162017822}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.20122306048870087}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0011806951370090246}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.7089431285858154}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.27040329575538635}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.020653558894991875}]]"
