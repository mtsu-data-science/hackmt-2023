###‚úîÔ∏è This is a thread for:

###‚ùå **It is not** a thread for:  
  
* Comments that aren't related to football.  
* Trolling or baiting other users or fanbases.  
* Low-effort comments about a current match.   
* Shitposting, brigading or excessive Meta discussion.      
* Any other kind of toxic or unreasonable behaviour.     
   
The moderation team will **remove** comments that violate those rules and **ban** persistent offenders.   
  
Please report comments you think that break such rules, but more than anything else, **remember the human**. The Internet is full of places to discuss football in bad faith. This community tries to be an exception.
