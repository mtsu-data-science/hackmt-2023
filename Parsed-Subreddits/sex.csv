Too pretty to give a good blow job?,"So I (f37) was out with two girlfriends at the weekend. We got chatting to a few guys. One took my eye and we danced and I asked if he wanted to leave with me. 

He said, and I quote, “You’re too pretty, you won’t give a good blow job.” I asked him what he meant and essentially it was that pretty girls don’t have to ‘work’ for it but plain girls have to work to get laid and so are better at blow jobs!!!

I was horrified and astounded - is this a universal truth that all guys believe or was he, as I suspect, full of shit?",3488.0,0.0,0.41112539172172546,0.5867989659309387,0.0020756612066179514,0.6324647068977356,0.3662327826023102,0.0013025248190388083
My friend woke me up with a bj and part of me feels extremely uncomfortable,"Me and her are both 18 and share an apartment together since we’ve been best friends for nearly 13 years. I’ve had a massive crush on her for a really long time but never told her since I was afraid of ruining the friendship. Well last night around 2 am I woke up to her drunkenly sucking my dick which felt really good and I allowed her to do it until I came. We cuddled for a bit and fell asleep but now that I’m fully awake I feel incredibly weird about it. I’m not angry and I did enjoy it but I feel a weird mix of shame and anxiety when I think about it. How do I deal with these feelings?

Edit: while I agree that she shouldn’t have done it without my consent I did enjoy it and I won’t hold that against her",3259.0,0.0,0.027805231511592865,0.003095029154792428,0.969099760055542,0.2586613893508911,0.7399705648422241,0.001368070486932993
I keep having a threesome that I don't rly want.,"Long story short. I (18f) keep having a threesome with my friend and the guy she likes. My friend (18f) has had a crush on her friends with benefits (29m) for a while now. A few months ago, he asked her if she wanted a threesome with him and one of her friends.

Because she's head over heels for him, she said yes. They asked me to have a threesome, and because I was drunk and wanted to help my friend out, I said yes.

Now fast forward to the present, my friend has repeatedly asked me to have more threesomes. She says she's getting really close to him, and that these threesomes are helping her to get closer. I really doubt this, but I do want to help out my friend.

I don't hate hooking up with them. They're both attractive and I enjoy the sex. But I don't like the guy, I feel like he's a douchebag. I don't think he'll ever want to be more than fwb with my friend.

What do I do?",3225.0,0.0,0.4052322804927826,0.006199799012392759,0.5885679125785828,0.9575283527374268,0.036788348108530045,0.005683390889316797
"My (M 47) wife (F 41) of 18 years who has never put any work into sex, pretty much had sex with a stripper in front of me.","So my wife and I have been together since 2005. She has never been a sexual person, and was only with one person, one time before me. I meet her when she was 24. She made me wait 5 months for sex, then sex was only about once a month afterwards. Took her a year to do oral even though she expected it from me. She would gag if I got cum on her or her lips. She never initiates sex and blows off most requests, but after I keep asking her to try new things and fulfill them. She has never asked me for anything in the sex area. We ended up going to marriage counseling about 2 years ago, and we learned how important sex and intimacy were in a marriage. Since then she has marginally tried to be better.

In the past, I would make big deals out of her Birthday, X-Mas, Valentine's Day, etc. She would never do anything for my BDay, buy me any X-Mas gifts, or if she did, very little thought. Was never there when I needed her (would rather go to lunch with her friends than drive me home after a hospital procedure). Counseling explained that a Spouse should come 1st, and I was being put 3rd or 4th.

Last night was my 47 Birthday, and we arrange a rare night with the kids over at the grandparents. We planned to do a Novel experience. We were going to go to a Strip Club which was BYOB just to start the night for an hour and then a club. We got to the strip club and I was instantly bored. But the woman were pulling my wife on stage, feeling her up and she was LOVING IT. They would be on top of her rubbing her all over, including between her legs and she was loudly moaning. I kept saying I wanted to leave but she kept telling me how it was one of the ""best times ever."" She was REALLY into one of the strippers and wanted a private dance in front of me. I told her I did not want that and would have rather spent the cash on a PS5 game I wanted. She insisted and went to the stripper herself and set up the deal

We went back into the room, and I was told I was only allowed to watch, my wife pretty much got completely naked and the stripper was completely naked. My wife kept telling the stripper how attractive she was over and over. Once they started my wife was all over her. Hands everywhere. There was a point the stripper was rubbing her naked crotch against my wife's name crotch and my wife was moaning so loud, I think she got there. My wife was so verbal during telling the stripper how attractive she was to her and how comfortable she made her with the biggest smile on her face the entire time. I HAVE NEVER SEEN MY WIFE THAT TURNED ON WITH ME EVER. I feel like she basically cheated on me and showed me she is a sexual person, just not with me.

It was a BYOB club, and my wife got drunk (2 shots before, and 1.5 can drinks there we brought and never left our sight). I do not drink. She did puke when she got home and I had to take care of her. My wife is always so conservative/reserved, It was strange seeing her that way.

Did she cheat? Why was she so excited to keep being pulled up on stage and have the strippers feel her up as she felt them up with the private dance, it was pretty much sex. I have NEVER seen my wife so excited about sex with me before. I am quite confused and hurt.",2601.0,0.0,0.03428623080253601,0.0028946069069206715,0.9628192782402039,0.8504785299301147,0.14098188281059265,0.008539603091776371
Is it petty if I refuse to give him a blowjob because he won't lick my clit?,"He refuses to even lick my clit (I told him he doesn't even need to stick his tongue in) therefore I'm going to stop giving him blowjobs. 

Is that petty and mean of me? I'm worried it might backfire.",2218.0,0.0,0.2624763250350952,0.005007782950997353,0.7325158715248108,0.08191707730293274,0.0032374339643865824,0.9148455858230591
