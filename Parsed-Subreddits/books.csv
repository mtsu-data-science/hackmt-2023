"The /r/books Book Club Selection + AMA for February is ""The Girl with the Louding Voice"" by Abi Daré",,7.0,0.0,,,"*If you are looking for the announcement thread for the previous month, it may be found* [*here*](

Hello, all. During the month of February, the sub book club will be reading **The Girl with the Louding Voice** by Abi Daré! Each week, there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Abi herself will be joining us for an AMA.

From [Goodreads]( (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):

>Despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in her path, Adunni never loses sight of her goal of escaping the life of poverty she was born into so that she can build the future she chooses for herself - and help other girls like her do the same.  
>  
>Her spirited determination to find joy and hope in even the most difficult circumstances imaginable will “break your heart and then put it back together again” (Jenna Bush Hager on The Today Show) even as Adunni shows us how one courageous young girl can inspire us all to reach for our dreams...and maybe even change the world. 

You may find the dates of, and links to, the discussion threads below in the sticky comment on this post. You are welcome to read at your own pace. Usually it is pretty easy to catch up and you are always welcome to join the discussions a little later. If you would like to view potential content warnings for the book, a reader-created list may be found [here](

"Weekly Recommendation Thread: January 27, 2023",,24.0,0.0,,,"Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

**The Rules**

* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

**How to get the best recommendations**

The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

____

All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, we've set the suggested sort to new; you may need to set this manually if your app or settings ignores suggested sort.

If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

American Psycho: Why does Patrick Bateman keep randomly changing the subject in his narration?,,1490.0,0.0,,,"I just started reading the book recently after seeing the movie countless times and quite honestly it quickly became one of my favorite books. 

So I got the part where he went to dinner with Courtney and some couple he found annoying. So he was talking about how the girl wanted a diet coke but her boyfriend kept trying to convince her to drink alcohol. So at some point she says she wants rum in the coke. But Bateman suggests she should have Pepsi instead. Then he says everyone looked at him disapprovingly. 

And then, out of nowhere, he gives a long detailed description of what he saw in some threesome porn video he rented. After that, he goes on about some Stephen Bishop record he bought. Then he takes the reader back to the dinner scene and the conversation about Pepsi and Diet Coke.

So, without spoiling the rest of the book, why does Bateman do this?","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.9054858088493347}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.09151849895715714}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0029957497026771307}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.6659582853317261}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.33270251750946045}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0013391778338700533}]]"
People really need to not focus on the reading habits of others.,,560.0,0.0,,,"Seriously, who cares how many books someone reads or how fast they or the reason they? Just let them enjoy what they read however they want, If ya see someone say they read slow, just be happy for them, if they read fast be happy for them, if they read only a few books be happy for them, if they read alot of books be happy for them and if they listen to audio books just be happy for them. Its not that hard to do and plus how another person reads does not affect your own reading habits in the slightest. So congrats to everyone who has their own reading habits.","[[{'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.8421965837478638}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.15314507484436035}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.0046583665534853935}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.7604270577430725}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.2337779998779297}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.005794915836304426}]]"
My young cousin f/13 is reading lots of colleen hoover books and I don’t know how to feel about it.,,232.0,0.0,,,"My cousin f/13 has always sort of really looked up to me—which is both great and horrifying because I don’t know how much of a guide I can be for her. I have noticed that she reads a lot of colleen hoover books and although I didn’t mind it at first because I thought they were just your average romance novels, I’ve realized that most of them have really dark plots and a lot of smut where consent is not necessarily obvious. I don’t think that is setting a good idea in her head since she’s young and impressionable, I’m afraid that exposure to such content will leave some negative effect on her. I don’t know whether I should gradually guide her in a different direction or if it’s just better to confront her and talk about why I don’t think she should be reading these books. I don’t know if I would be justified in doing so either because I haven’t personally read any of those novels. What do you people think?

Edit: just for context, because I realized that most of you are looking at this from a western perspective. But we (me and my cousin) live in a middle-eastern society, sex is almost never discussed. If it’s discussed, it’s shamed. Her parents are both religious, I would literally never tell _them_ about this. And I want to make it clear that smut is okay with me as long as its not non-consensual. She’s had little exposure to sexuality, and I’m only concerned that this kind of exposure might sort of normalize it for her.","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8973840475082397}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.05914800986647606}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.04346795007586479}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.8228918313980103}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.16604386270046234}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.011064247228205204}]]"
