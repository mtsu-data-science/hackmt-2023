Bots and AI generated answers on r/explainlikeimfive,,1927.0,0.0,,,"Recently, there's been a surge in ChatGPT generated posts. These come in two flavours: bots creating and posting answers, and human users generating answers with ChatGPT and copy/pasting them. Regardless of whether they are being posted by bots or by people, answers generated using ChatGPT and other similar programs are a direct violation of R3, which requires all content posted here to be original work. We don't allow copied and pasted answers from anywhere, and that includes from ChatGPT programs. Going forward, any accounts posting answers generated from ChatGPT or similar programs will be permanently banned in order to help ensure a continued level of high-quality and informative answers. We'll also take this time to remind you that bots are not allowed on ELI5 and will be banned when found.","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8749100565910339}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.07461553066968918}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.050474442541599274}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.742744505405426}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.2431066930294037}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.014148757793009281}]]"
