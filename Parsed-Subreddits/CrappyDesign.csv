**Something you think is ugly is not necessarily crappy design. Something you don't understand does not make the design of that item crappy design. Not every ramp you see is meant for wheelchair access. Not every item that puzzles you is bad design. Items which are installed badly or broken are not crappy design.**

So please refrain from  posting ugly fabrics, devices you haven't been able to figure out, random things that puzzle you and the like. *This is not a complete list and all submissions are subject to mod review.*


**This past weekend we saw a rule breaking post with not only identifying information but phone numbers  and a comment section full of comments harassing the people pictured. This is unacceptable.
