I miss physical stores,"Last time I bought a keyboard and mouse was over 10 years ago. I walked into a Fry's Electronics and pushed keys on a dozen keyboards and felt how the mouse conformed to my particular hand.
I bought my headphones online and I regretted that since they didn't fully fit over my ears.

How the hell am I supposed to pick a keyboard from the 100 that all look pretty much the same online... Mouse seems like even worse of a prospect.",2229.0,0.0,0.6162128448486328,0.029447447508573532,0.35433974862098694,0.8442167043685913,0.01522765588015318,0.14055566489696503
Forget about paying extra for a mobo with better audio unless you're going to spend pretty serious money on your headphones or speakers.,"I've been watching a fairly popular YouTuber lately who keeps recommending paying more money for better audio on the motherboard. (But usually not a ton more, to be fair to him.)

The problem is, he never mentions that your sound quality is wayyyy more dependent on your headphones or speakers than on the motherboard. And if you're using a USB headset, the motherboard's audio output straight up isn't even involved at all.

Just something that's been annoying me a bit.",1879.0,0.0,0.8104108572006226,0.15166732668876648,0.037921831011772156,0.8498994708061218,0.10682771354913712,0.04327281564474106
