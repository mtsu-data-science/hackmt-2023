Is Raytracing worth it ?,,472.0,0.0,,,"I am currently building a new Pc, and i am stuck between choosing an Nvidia or Amd card ; but as it turns out, Amd is slightly better in rasterized performance, while Nvidia is much better in RT performance.

That got me wondering : Just how relevant is Raytracing in 2023 ? Most threads i could find are very old and not up to date and just moan how Raytracing is too big of a performance hit and not even supported by most games ; but that trend has changed lately.

So how big of a deal is Raytracing in 2023 ? Is it a selling point when choosing a graphics card ?","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.965964674949646}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.030467312783002853}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0035679766442626715}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.7307949662208557}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.26630839705467224}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0028966909740120173}]]"
"Dying 5800x, should I replace it with a 5800x3d or another 5800x?",,73.0,0.0,,,"Here is my current build:

5800x cooled by scythe FUMA 2 ver B

32gb corsair vengeance RGB Pro 3600

ASUS B550m-PLUS mobo

ASUS rtx 3070 Dual

Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVME 1tb -OS drive

Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVME 2tb -games and applications

Hitachi 7200rpm 3TB backup drive

Thermaltake Level 20 VT with all corsair LL120s and 140s tied into rgb controllers and then into a Corsair commander.  (pretty wind tunnel lol)

Long story short I have started to get WHEA errors (hard crash and no minidumps) and after troubleshooting every part listed here what fixed it was borrowing a friends 5900x.

So my dilemma: I can't be without a system as I use it for work too.  So do I buy a new 5800x or 5800x3d?  I will be upgrading in a year anyway but will be passing down my rig to my younger brother in the time honored tradition of hand-me-downs.

I play a lot of games and do some content creation for work.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts?","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.94571453332901}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.029350996017456055}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.024934429675340652}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.72135329246521}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.2769874334335327}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0016593118198215961}]]"
Do majority of people turn their PCs off at night? What about if you leave for an hour or two in the daytime?,,831.0,0.0,,,Is it true that restarting is the only true way to refresh a PC?

Ryzen 5 5600x and RTX 3070 in 2023,,18.0,0.0,,,"Thinking of upgrading my 4.5 years old pc (Ryzen 5 2600 & GTX 1070), till now I was thinking of upgrading it with 5600x and 3070 but few days ago I started wondering if these two are worth buying in 2023 and if they will last and be good in 2-3 years. I dont know if I should wait few more months for prices of ryzen 7000 series cpus and motherboards or Intel's 13th gen to go down and for rest of rtx 4000 gpus to be released. What do you guys think?","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8195602893829346}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.17858478426933289}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0018549170345067978}]]","[[{'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.5544589161872864}, {'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.44415509700775146}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.001385964686051011}]]"
