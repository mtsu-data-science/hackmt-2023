/r/AdviceAnimals rules: Please read before submitting or commenting,,1271.0,0.0,,,"## Community Rules

##Rule 1: Reddit's site-wide rules


**[Click Here]( for reddit's 6 rules.**  

They are all pretty straight forward and easy to understand, but if you would like more information about them [**Click Here**]( for reddit's Frequently Asked Questions page.

**Be sure to also read [the rediquette]( which is an informal guide to reddit etiquette.**

_____

##Rule 2: Don't be a jerk


**We're here to have a laugh; hate speech, bigotry, and personal attacks are not allowed.**

**Death threats and telling others to kill themselves will result in a ban.**

This is pretty self explanatory.

_____


##Rule 3: Follow the correct format


**Two line joke over a re-usable character.** 

We understand that some established memes do not follow this format, such as 

* [What Year Is It?](

* [I Should Buy a Boat Cat](

* Etc

However, these memes are already well established and thus have been grandfathered in.

**Not all image macros are memes**

>Meme -

>/mÄ“m/

>noun

>an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, esp. imitation.

>[source](

Basically if the image is only relevant to one's own submission and can't be re-used (or has limited re-usability) then it's just an image macro and by definition not a meme.

* [This is an example of a generic image macro.](

and

* [This is an example of a meme.](

Memes are allowed on the subreddit here, while generic image macros are better suited for /r/funny. 

_____

##Rule 4: Don't repost

**Don't post stuff you found from elsewhere on the web, it's probably been here already.**

This subreddit is for original content only, meaning memes YOU made. 

Do not resubmit your post because it did poorly. 

Reposting is a bannable offense.

If you see a repost please report it as such, and [send a quick note to the mods]( if you can.

____

##Rule 5: No Cake Day Posts

**Cake Day posts are not allowed.**

Posts that mention Cake Day in the title, or in the post itself will be removed.

____


##Rule 6: Verticals, Puffins and Batman Slaps

**Please do not post Verticals, Opinion Puffins or Batman Slaps.**

Verticals are multiple panel memes or image macros and both are better suited for either /r/funny or /r/vertical.

* [This is an example of a vertical meme.](

* [This is an example of a vertical image macro](

This also means posts such as [9/11 Lois]( aren't allowed; and memes such as [Nobody cares Nedry]( and [Confused Gandalf]( are limited to their 1 panel standard, instead of their alternate vertical counterparts.

2 AdviceAnimals in a vertical are OK.

Meaning combining 2 established memes together such as [Socially Awkward Penguin]( and [Socially Awesome Penguin]( is fine.

[Here is an example of its acceptable use](




* [This is unpopular opinion puffin](

* [This is an example of a Batman Slap](

_____


##Rule 7: Link directly to your image

**Make sure you link directly to your image.**

In other words, not just to the website, or the gallery page.

Here are a few examples.

* OK.




* Not OK.








_____


##Rule 8: People you know

**Don't make memes with pics of people that you saw in real life. Ever.**

Don't try to make yourself or someone you know into a meme.

Also, we do not allow witch hunts on the subreddit.

_____

##Rule 9: Use an approved host

**Shortened links, Facebook, Tumblr, Blogspot, etc, will be automatically removed.**

Please use one of the approved websites listed on the sidebar to make your post.

_____

##Rule 10: Mods have the final say

**We reserve the right to remove posts, remove comments, and ban users at our own discretion.**

Due to the nature of the subreddit, interpretations of what is a meme and what is an image macro sometimes have different opinions and thus decisions have to be made.
