To say that the Obsidian Court was stunned would be an understatement. War, for an infraction my kingdom had never done? The silence was deafening as Eidolon, my right hand and advisor, gripped his spear tightly, restraining the fury that the blank faced being kept well in check. My friend took one step to the right, towards the so called princess, and with that step, the silence broke. Whispers from the nobles in my court started in earnest, but there was an undercurrent of anger from each whisper. My Ward, Lady Anda or the so called Princess Auryn, was pale faced with terror as the message finished, not quite getting up but leaning towards Eidolon, as if to try and hide behind my advisor. Curious. I had not known until now that Eidolon and Lady Anda had become close.

The messenger quivered as he rolled the scroll back up, his gaudy but clearly expensive uniform nearly flapping with how he shook. Not one of the usual sycophants that I saw from the Krytannish Empire, but a royal messenger, and thus, one who was at least a bit more intelligent than what I usually saw from the Empire.

With a quavering voice, as he realized this might be the very last message he would ever read, the courier bowed low. “Thus does the message from his Excellency, Emperor Carlasan the Fifth, end. Uh... what... what response shall I carry to the emperor for you, Tyrant Adamant?”

His voice cracked at the end, clearly terrified. He had nothing to fear at this time, as I had not given my answer, and even so, capable and brave couriers were hard to come by. All considerations had to be given, and war was not something that my kingdom would ever take lightly, despite my bloodthirsty reputation. A relic of my younger years, perhaps.

“You will stay the night. In the morning, courier, we will have a response for his Excellency.” My tone brooked no dispute, and the messenger bowed low, as one of my guard left their post, in sync with my wishes to take the royal messenger to where he would stay the night.Relief and delayed terror were clear on his face as the orcish sergeant took him gently by the arm to lead him out of the court. As soon as the doors closed, the nobles' whispers erupted into shouts, some for war, some against, but all furious.

My subjects were passionate, even the most decorated of nobles, but this would not be solved in rage. The cacophony continued for a single moment before I motioned to Eidolon, who stamped his spear on the black stone of the throne room, three times.

By the third time the spear haft struck the stone, the massive room was a silent as a grave. “First, we will hear from Lady Anda.”

I turned to her, and she swallowed, hard, but mastered her expression as the nobility that she had become in my court. I could not help it, but my voice softened, just a touch. She had changed so much in the years since the young lady, bruised and battered, arrived at the borders of my nation, requesting asylum. Now she stood, clad in a form fitting silver and black mithril gown that focused on practical movement and protection as much as beauty and style, the current fashion of the orc nobility that she'd lately become enamored with. “Is this true, Lady Anda? Are you really the lost princess of the Krytannish Empire, Princess Auryn?”

She bowed to me, then turned to the court. Her voice was no longer there weak, exhausted and reedy voice of the teenage girl she had been, but of a powerful woman who knew how to speak to beings that considered her as a peer.

“It is true, my Tyrant, my lords and ladies. I am Princess Auryn. I sought refuge in the Umbral Kingdom, from my eldest brother, who is Carlasan the Fifth. I had thought, at the time, that even if the stories my family had told were true about the Umbral Kingdom, it could be no worse than my brother.”

Her voice trembled in the last phrase, but she mastered herself, and turned back to me, bowing. “I wish for no war to happen between my homeland, and the Umbral Kingdom, my Tyrant. But I must be honest, as you have always asked for that from me, and my peers. I would rather die than ever go back to my brother.” From her bow, she straightened, and looked me in the eye with pained, but resolute hazel eyes, and knelt down before me, bowing her head. “But for the sake of thousands, or millions of lives that my brother might throw away to get me back... I will walk back into that pit. Because I have come to love this country, and its people.”

A quiet wave of whispers ran through the nobles as she knelt before me. I placed one clawed hand on her head, quietly steadying her trembling, and lifted her head up. “Well said, Lady Anda. Please, take your seat. Your words will be weighed.”

I looked out to my court, and asked, “Who else will speak for war, or against? We would hear this courts opinions, before we make our decision.”

Duke Sanguine stepped forward after a moment of deliberation in the nobility, and bowed low. The vampire duke was a thin, tall man of corpse pale skin and blood red eyes, who had led the undead contingent of my subjects for the last ten years. He wore silk that made no sound when he moved, a drab black coloration that seemed to meld with jet black glass my throne room was made, and only a touch of red lining to add color that I personally knew he loathed.

“My Tyrant, Lady Anda. The Empire has put us in a truly terrible position. I must advise against war, and that we send Lady Anda to Carlasan the Fifth, temporarily. There are ways and methods we can use to return Lady Anda to her proper home, in the Umbral Kingdom, but open war could lead to our annihilation. We can negotiate, and delay, and perhaps even sabotage... but open war? No.” The duke looked pained for a moment, then looked directly at Lady Anda, and continued.

“I mean no disrespect, my dear Lady. You, your kindness, and your sharp mind have done as much for my people as I have in my centuries of unlife. It is just the most efficient solution, with the least amount of blood spilled.” The duke bowed again, and withdrew. Lady Anda swallowed, and bowed slightly in acknowledgment of the duke's personal addendum.

“Well said, Duke Sanguine. Your words will be weighed.”

A large, burly Orc in fine but plain brown robes slightly too tight for his hefty frame stepped forward. Duke Chargath, leader of the goblinoid and orc contingent of my court, bowed low, and in a higher voice that did not seem to fit his massive frame, said, “My Tyrant, Lady Anda. I agree with Duke Sanguine that the Empire has put us in a terrible position, but I cannot accept his conclusion. We may be outnumbered, my Tyrant, but the Umbral Kingdom is our home. Lady Anda is a citizen, and the numerous improvements to our ways she has assisted our people with are irrelevant. She is Umbran. Giving anything to that puffed up gold manchild of an Emperor, especially one of our citizens, knowing what he's done? My apologies to the Infernal Exiles, but HELL no. I say let us give a war the Empire will never forget, for daring to try and take one of our people.”

The passion of the orcish duke seemed to carry, and there were whispers of assent in the obsidian throne room.

“Well said, Duke Chargath. Your words will be weighed.”

And so it went. Each representative of my subjects, arguing for or against a war with our next door neighbor, powerful in their own right, late into the evening and into the early morning. Voices were raised, and tempers flared, but each time that it happened, Lady Anda or Eidolon was there to calm misdirected anger, or offensives inadvertently given, without my influence being exerted.

It would have been novel, had it not been something I had seen for the past year. Lady Anda and Eidolon worked well together, and I had no idea how I had missed that their closeness was more than just working well together. Age was catching up to me, perhaps.

Finally, after all the nobles had their chance to speak, with their words weighed, I turned to Eidolon. Like myself, Eidolon was unique in my court, and when he spoke, his words swayed minds and hearts with irrefutable logic and planning.

“Eidolon, our advisor, you have yet to speak. What is your opinion?”

The blank faced creature turned to look at me, then gripped his spear carefully, considering his words then in a quiet voice that carried through the throne room, said, “I must recuse myself, my Tyrant. My personal feelings are at war with what logically makes sense.” Shock ran through the court once again, this time in sheer surprise. Eidolon had always had an opinion on something, and had never recused himself from advising me on anything, when I had asked for his opinion.

Some of the nobles looked from Eidolon to Lady Anda, and back again. Oh, thank goodness. I wasn't the only one who had missed it.

I recovered from my brief shock, with a nod of my head to the spear wielding warrior. “Noted, Eidolon. Thank you for your honesty.”

I turned back to my court, and stood, considering their words. Each opinion was not without merit, those who chased power foolishly in my court were slain or deposed quickly, and each knew that they had to give value to me, and in turn, the Umbral Kingdom.

“Send for the messenger. We have reached our decision.” Lady Anda swallowed again, and did not look at me, as she shifted in her seat. A whisper of power, a thought to Eidolon made it's way from my mind. My friend glanced at me, and the blank face rippled in quickly concealed thanks, as he made his way over to Lady Anda's seat, placing a hand on her shoulder quietly. Another effort of will, and shades hidden in the shadows of the throne room fled with the speed of nightmares to carry orders to the ends of the kingdom.

The royal messenger came in a few minutes later, looking haggard and half asleep, clearly not expecting to be woken so early. The sun was barely peeking over the mountains in the east, the first few red rays streaming through the windows. He straightened his robes, waking himself further as I stood before him, realizing that I had an answer for him, that business such as war would need exact words.

“A brief history lesson, messenger, so that my words will convey the weight that is required for my response. The Umbral Kingdom's land, before it's legal formation, was carved by the devastation of a dragon, the very last dragon. Do you know the legend?”

The messenger swallowed, tilting his head as he searched his memory “Yes, your excellency. The Catastrophe, as it was called and that it happened some thousand years ago. Though nowadays people believe it was just multiple volcanoes erupting, causing the, ah, formations of the mountains at the borders of the Umbral Kingdom and what was the beginning of the Krytannish Empire. Not some mythical ancient being.”

Honesty, from a messenger, even if he knew I would not like the answer. I would have to see about hiring this one away in the coming days. Even so, in an icy tone, I continued, “We'll have to correct your history books.”

The messenger gaped like a fish for a moment, trying to understand what I was saying, before giving up.

“Your excellency, I... I'm not sure I understand what I should tell the Emperor.”

The workings that I've held together begin to come undone, a single thread in the tapestry of magic pulled. A smile comes unbidden to me, as my control over this body slowly unravels. So much effort to creating it, so many years ago. It feels like finally releasing a breath I've held for so long. I slump into the throne that I've held for the last centuries, and my good friend Eidolon steadies me, as more of the magic unravels. Lady Anda and my court gasp in shock, Anda herself rushes to my side, grabbing my hand, her skin warm against my cooling flesh. Despite the failing of the body, my words come out strong. In the distance, I see that Duke Sanguine understands first, and the vicious, bloodthirsty smile from that malicious man almost makes me laugh. His whispers set off a flurry, and soon my court's concern turns to shock, intrigue and confident satisfaction.

“Your wretched, insignificant worm of an emperor will reap what he has sown, by threatening war, to take my citizens' peace, to take my ward, to try and force me, of all creatures, to violate my given word. Maintaining the corruption of his crown, of his family line's tiresome, continuous threats against my kingdom, my subjects, and now my ward? Tell the Emperor that it is war and...”

I put my hand on Lady Anda's own, as the last bits of magic drain from the body, releasing my spirit from its mortal confines, with a whisper and a promise.

“He has awoken the Catastrophe.” And a dragon's roar, my roar, shattered the stillness of the dawn morning, the mountain range that I had made my resting place, and the border between the Empire and my kingdom.
