"General Questions & Tech Support Megathread | July 04, 2022",,292.0,0.0,,,"Hi everyone,

After a few months, this thread is now becoming bi-weekly, as a way to make questions less scattered over threads.

As a reminder, the following threads are no longer allowed on [r/PS4]( and will be removed:

* **Tech Support questions** (""I have a problem"", ""My controller doesn't work"", ""I can't connect to PSN""...)
* **Game recommendation** (""Which game should I get?"", ""Is this game good?"")
* **General questions** (""Where can I get a PS4?"", ""What do you think of this controller?"")

**Those questions now have to be asked in this thread**. It will be renewed at 12:00 PM EST on Mondays and Fridays.

This thread is sorted by **New answers by default**. Sorting it by Top or Best could give answers to commonly answered questions.

Also, don't forget to google your question first - you might find the answer before asking it here!","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9800594449043274}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.017081953585147858}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.0028587074484676123}]]","[[{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.8774952292442322}, {'label': 'POS', 'score': 0.12021658569574356}, {'label': 'NEG', 'score': 0.002288185991346836}]]"
